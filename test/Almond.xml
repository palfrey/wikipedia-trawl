The '''almond''' ('''''Prunus dulcis''''', [[Synonym (taxonomy)#Botany|syn.]] ''Prunus amygdalus'' Batsch., ''Amygdalus communis'' L., ''Amygdalus dulcis'' Mill.), is a species of tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. Almond is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree. Within the genus ''[[Prunus]]'', it is classified with the [[peach]] in the subgenus ''Amygdalus'', distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated shell ([[endocarp]]) surrounding the seed.

The fruit of the almond is not a [[nut (fruit)|true nut]], but a [[drupe]], consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed (&quot;nut&quot;) inside.  Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the [[seed]]. Almonds are commonly sold '''shelled''', i.e. after the shells are removed, or '''unshelled''', i.e. with the shells still attached. '''[[Blanching (cooking)|Blanched]]''' almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the [[seedcoat]], which is then removed to reveal the white [[embryo]].

== Description ==
===Tree===
The almond is a small [[deciduous]] [[tree]], growing to between 4 and 10 meters in height, with a trunk of up to 30 centimetres in diameter. The young [[twig]]s are green at first, becoming purplish where exposed to sunlight, then grey in their second year. The [[leaf|leaves]] are 3–5&amp;nbsp;inches long,&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H.; Bailey, E.Z.; the staff of the Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium. 1976. ''Hortus third: A concise dictionary of plants cultivated in the United States and Canada''. Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; with a serrated margin and a {{convert|2.5|cm|0|abbr=on}} [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]. The [[flower]]s are white or pale pink, 3–5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter with five petals, produced singly or in pairs before the leaves in early spring.&lt;ref name=rushforth&gt;{{cite book |last=Rushforth |first=Keith |title=Collins wildlife trust guide trees: a photographic guide to the trees of Britain and Europe |publisher=Harper Collins |location=London |year=1999 |isbn=0-00-220013-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=Mark D. |coauthors=Anthony Julian Huxley |title=The New Royal Horticultural Society dictionary of gardening |publisher=Macmillan Press |location=London |year=1992 |isbn=0-333-47494-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almond trees become productive and begin bearing fruit after five years.  The fruit is mature in the autumn, 7–8 months after flowering.&lt;ref name=rushforth/&gt;&lt;ref name=rhs/&gt;

===Nut===
In botanical terms, the almond fruit is not a [[nut (fruit)|nut]], but a [[drupe]] 3.5–6&amp;nbsp;cm long. The outer covering or [[exocarp]], fleshy in other members of ''Prunus'' such as the [[plum]] and [[cherry]], is instead a thick leathery grey-green coat (with a downy exterior), called the hull. Inside the hull is a reticulated hard woody shell (like the outside of a peach pit) called the [[endocarp]]. Inside the shell is the edible seed, commonly called a nut. Generally, one seed is present, but occasionally there are two{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

== Origin and history ==
The almond is a native to the [[Mediterranean climate]] region of the [[Middle East]], eastward as far as the [[Indus]].&lt;ref name=Rieger&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vUXKIkjDtAQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA38 Introduction to Fruit Crops], p. 38, Mark Rieger, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It was spread by humans in ancient times along the shores of the Mediterranean into northern Africa and southern Europe and more recently transported to other parts of the world, notably [[California]], United States.&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;
[[Image:Almondtrees.jpg|thumb|left|A grove of almond trees in southern California]]

The wild form of domesticated almond grows in parts of the [[Levant]]; almonds must first have been taken into cultivation in this region. The fruit of the wild forms contains the [[glycoside]] [[amygdalin]], &quot;which becomes transformed into deadly prussic acid ([[hydrogen cyanide]]) after crushing, chewing, or any other injury to the seed.&quot;&lt;ref name=zohary&gt;{{cite book |last=Zohary |first=Daniel |coauthors=Maria Hopf |title=Domestication of plants in the old world: the origin and spread of cultivated plants in West Asia, Europe, and the Nile Valley |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |pages=186 |isbn=0-19-850356-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, domesticated almonds are not toxic; [[Jared Diamond]] argues that a common genetic mutation causes an absence of glycoside amygdalin, and this mutant was grown by early farmers, &quot;at first unintentionally in the garbage heaps, and later intentionally in their orchards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=[[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, germs, and steel: the fates of human societies]] |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=1997 |pages=118 |isbn=0-393-03891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zohary and Hopf believe that almonds were one of the earliest domesticated fruit trees due to &quot;the ability of the grower to raise attractive almonds from seed. Thus, in spite of the fact that this plant does not lend itself to propagation from suckers or from cuttings, it could have been domesticated even before the introduction of [[grafting]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=zohary/&gt; Domesticated almonds appear in the [[Early Bronze Age]] (3000–2000 BC) of the Near East, or possibly a little earlier. A well-known archaeological example of the almond is the fruit found in [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb in Egypt (c. 1325 BC), probably imported from the Levant.&lt;ref name=zohary/&gt;  Of the [[Europe]]an countries that the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh reported as cultivating almonds, [[Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://193.62.154.38/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&amp;GENUS_XREF=Prunus&amp;SPECIES_XREF=dulcis&amp;TAXON_NAME_XREF=&amp;RANK= |title=''Flora Europaea'' Search Results |accessdate=2008-07-17 |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the northernmost, though the domesticated form can be found as far north as [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pfaf/cgi-bin/arr_html?Prunus+dulcis |title=''Prunus dulcis'' |accessdate=2008-07-17 |publisher=[[Plants for a Future]]}} {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology and names ===
{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}
The word &quot;almond&quot; comes from Old French ''almande'' or ''alemande'', [[Late Latin]] ''amandola'', derived through a form ''amingdolouhha'' from the Greek ''αμυγδαλη'' (cf [[amygdala]]), an almond. The ''al-'' in English, for the ''a-'' used in other languages may be due  a confusion with the [[Arabic]] article ''al'', the word having first dropped the ''a-'' as in the [[Italian language|Italian]] form ''mandorla''; the British pronunciation ''ah-mond'' and the modern Catalan ''ametlla'' and modern French ''amande'' show a form of the word closer to the original.

The adjective ''amygdaloid'' (literally &quot;like an almond&quot;) is used to describe objects which are roughly almond-shaped, particularly a shape which is part way between a [[rectangle]] and an [[ellipse]]. See, for example, the [[neuroanatomy|brain structure]] ''[[amygdala]]'', which uses a direct borrowing of the Greek term.

Almond is called لوز ''lawz'' in [[Arabic]] and ''bâdom'' in [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam]], [[Kannada]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]],[[Uyghur]].   and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]].In [[German language|German]] almond is called &quot;Mandel&quot;, as well as  &quot;Almond&quot;. In [[Hebrew]] almond is called שקד ''shaqed'', which has its roots in an ancient [[Semitic]] term, as seen in the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''šiqdu'' and [[Ugaritic]] ''thaqid'', as well as in old [[Ethiopic]] terms.

== Production ==
[[File:AlmondShakerbeforeafter.jpg|thumb|right|An almond shaker before and during a harvest of a tree]]
Global production of almonds is around 1.7 million tonnes, with a low of 1 million tonnes in 1995 and a peak of 1.85 million tonnes in 2002 according to [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) figures; world production of almonds was 1.76 million tonnes in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/Hort_Circular/2004/12-10-04/12-04%20Almonds.pdf United States Department of Agriculture]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FAO, major producers are the USA (715,623 t, 41%), Spain (220,000 t, 13%), Syria (119,648 t, 7%), Italy (112,796 t, 6%), Iran (108,677 t, 6%) and Morocco (83,000 t, 5%). Algeria, Tunisia, and Greece each account for 3%, Turkey, Pakistan, Lebanon, and China each account for 2%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Turkey]], most of the production comes from the [[Datça Peninsula]]. In Spain, numerous commercial cultivars of sweet almond are produced, most notably the Jordan almond (imported from [[Málaga]]) and the [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] almond.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In the United States, production is concentrated in [[California]], with almonds being California's third leading agricultural product and its top agricultural export in 2008. California produces 80% of the world’s almonds&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/horticulture/Tree%20Nuts/2009_Almonds.pdf USDA Foreign Agricultural Service 2009/2010 Almond Forecast Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; and 100% of the U.S. commercial supply. California exported almonds valued at $1.08 billion in 2003, about 70% of total California almond crop.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

=== Pollination ===
The [[pollination]] of California's almonds is the largest annual [[Pollination management|managed pollination]] event in the world, with close to one million hives (nearly half of all [[beehive (beekeeping)|beehives]] in the USA) being trucked in February to the almond groves. Much of the pollination is managed by pollination brokers, who contract with migratory [[beekeeper]]s from at least 49 states for the event.  This business has been heavily impacted by [[colony collapse disorder]], causing nationwide shortages of honey bees and increasing the price of [[insect pollination]].  To alleviate almond growers from the rising cost of insect pollination, researchers at the [[Agricultural Research Service]] (ARS) have developed a new line of [[self-pollinating]] almond trees.&lt;ref name=ARS&gt;Alfredo Flores. &quot;[http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100406.htm ARS Scientists Develop Self-pollinating Almond Trees]&quot;. [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service]], April 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Self-pollinating almond trees, such as the [[Tuono]] almond tree, have been around for a while, but their harvest is not as desirable as the insect-pollinated California Nonpareil almond tree.  The Nonpareil tree produces large, smooth almonds and offer 60–65% edible kernel per nut.  The Tuono, on the other hand, has thicker, hairier shells and offers only 32% of edible kernel per nut.  However, there are advantages to having a thick shell.  The Tuono’s shell protects the nut from threatening pests such as the [[navel orangeworm]].  ARS researchers have managed to cross breed the pest-resistant Tuono tree with California’s attractive Nonpareil tree, resulting in [[hybridized]] varieties of almond trees that are self-pollinated and maintain a high quality of nut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Sweet and bitter almonds==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hydrogen cyanide]] --&gt;
[[Image:Almond blossom02 aug 2007.jpg|right|thumb|Flowering (sweet) almond tree]]
[[File:Rose ringed Parakeet in bitter Almond.jpg|right|thumb|Blossom on bitter almond tree]]
There are two forms of the plant, one (often with white flowers) producing [[sweet]] almonds, and the other (often with pink flowers) producing [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]] almonds. The kernel of the former contains a fixed oil and emulsion. As late as the early 20th century, the oil was used internally in medicine, with the stipulation that it must not be adulterated with that of the bitter almond; it remains fairly popular in [[alternative medicine]], particularly as a [[carrier oil]] in [[aromatherapy]], but has fallen out of prescription among doctors{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

The bitter almond is slightly broader and shorter than the sweet almond, and contains about 50% of the fixed oil that occurs in sweet almonds. It also contains the enzyme [[emulsin]] which, in the presence of water, acts on a [[soluble]] [[glucoside]], [[amygdalin]], yielding [[glucose]], [[cyanide]] and the [[essential oil]] of bitter almonds, which is nearly pure [[benzaldehyde]]. Bitter almonds may yield from 4–9&amp;nbsp;mg of [[hydrogen cyanide]] per almond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karkocha I |title=[Semiquantitative method of hydrogen cyanide and sweet almonds] |language=Polish |journal=Roczniki Państwowego Zakładu Higieny |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=703–5 |year=1973 |month=January |pmid=4775628}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shragg TA, Albertson TE, Fisher CJ |title=Cyanide poisoning after bitter almond ingestion |journal=West.

[[File:Smoked almonds.JPG|thumb|left|Smoked and salted almonds]]
While the almond is often eaten on its own, raw or toasted, it is also a component of various dishes. Almonds are available in many forms, such as whole, sliced (flaked, slivered), and as almond butter, almond milk and almond oil. These variations can be used in both sweet and savory dishes.

Along with other nuts, sweet almonds can be sprinkled over desserts, particularly ice cream based dishes. Sweet almonds are used in [[marzipan]], [[nougat]], many pastries (including [[jesuite]]s), cookies (including [[macaron|French macarons]], [[macaroon]]s), and cakes (including [[Financier (pastry)|financiers]]), [[noghl]] and other sweets and desserts. They are also used to make [[almond butter]], a spread similar to [[peanut butter]], popular with [[peanut allergy]] sufferers and for its less salty taste. The young, developing fruit of the almond tree can be eaten whole (&quot;green almonds&quot;) when they are still green and fleshy on the outside and the inner shell has not yet hardened. The fruit is somewhat sour, but is a popular snack in parts of the Middle East, eaten dipped in salt to balance the sour taste. Available only from mid April to mid June (northern hemisphere), pickling or brining extends the fruit's shelf life.

In [[Italy]], sweet almonds are the base for [[amaretti]] (almond macaroons), a common dessert. Traditionally, a low percentage of bitter almonds (10-20%) is added to the ingredients, which gives the cookies their bitter taste (commercially, [[apricot kernel]]s are used as a substitute for bitter almonds). Almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in [[torrone]]. In [[Puglia]] and [[Sicily]], &quot;pasta di mandorle&quot; (almond paste) is used to make small soft cakes, often decorated with jam, [[pistacchio]] or chocolate.

In [[Greece]], ground blanched almonds are used as the base material in a great variety of desserts, usually called ''amygdalota'' (αμυγδαλωτά).  Because of their white colour, most are traditionally considered &quot;wedding sweets&quot; and are served at wedding banquets (also in [[Turkey]]). In addition, a soft drink known as ''[[soumada]]'' is made from almonds in various regions.

In [[Iran]], green almonds are dipped in [[sea salt]] and eaten as snacks on street markets; they are called '''Chaqalu bâdom'''.

In [[China]], almonds are used in a popular dessert where they are mixed with milk and then served hot.

In [[Morocco]], almonds in the form of [[almond paste]] are the main ingredient in several [[List_of_Moroccan_dishes#Desserts|desserts]]. Whole fried almonds are also used in sweet [[tajine]]s.  A drink made from almonds mixed with milk is served in important ceremonies such as weddings and can also be ordered in some cafes.

In [[Pakistani cuisine|Pakistan]] , almonds are the base ingredients of many food items. Meat dishes containing almonds include [[pasanda]]-style or Mughalai[[curry|curries]]. [[Badam halva]] is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as [[sohan barfi]]), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface. Almonds form the base of various drinks which are supposed to have cooling properties. Almond sherbet or 'Sherbet-e-Badaam' in [[Urdu]], is a popular summer drink. Almonds are also sold as a snack with added salt.

In  [[Indian cuisine|India]], almonds are the base ingredients of [[pasanda]]-style [[curry|curries]]. [[Badam halva]] is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as [[sohan barfi]]), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface.

Almonds can be processed into a [[milk substitute]] called [[almond milk]]; the nut's soft texture, mild flavour, and light colouring (when skinned) make for an efficient analog to dairy, and a soy-free choice, for [[lactose intolerant]] people and [[vegans]]. Raw, blanched, and lightly toasted almonds all work well for different production techniques, some of which are very similar to that of [[soymilk]] and some of which actually use no heat, resulting in &quot;raw milk&quot; (see [[raw foodism]]).

The [[Marcona (almond)|Marcona]] variety of almond, which is shorter, rounder, sweeter, and more delicate in texture than other varieties, originated in Spain and is becoming popular in North America and other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tienda.com/press/mercurynews.html Marcona almonds]&lt;/ref&gt; Marcona almonds are traditionally served after being lightly fried in oil, and are also used by Spanish chefs to prepare a dessert called ''[[turrón]]''.

=== Almond syrup ===
{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}
Historically, almond syrup was an [[emulsion]] of sweet and bitter almonds, usually made with [[barley syrup]] ([[orgeat syrup]]) or in a syrup of [[orange-flower water]] and [[sugar]].

''[[The Grocer's Encyclopedia]]'' (1911) notes that &quot;Ten parts of sweet almonds are generally employed to three parts of bitter almonds&quot;; however, due to the [[cyanide]] found in bitter almonds, modern syrups generally consist of only sweet almonds.

== Oils ==
{{Ref improve section|date=November 2010}}
Almonds contain approximately 49% [[fats|oils]], of which 62% is monounsaturated [[oleic acid]] (an [[omega-9 fatty acid]]), 24% is [[linoleic acid]] (a polyunsaturated [[omega-6]] [[essential fatty acid]]), and 6% is [[palmitic acid]] (a [[saturated fatty acid]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ Search the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference] under &quot;Nuts, almonds&quot;. [[Agricultural Research Service]], [[United States Department of Agriculture]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Oleum Amygdalae&quot;, the fixed oil, is prepared from either variety of almond and is a glyceryl oleate, with a slight odour and a nutty taste. It is almost insoluble in [[ethanol|alcohol]] but readily soluble in [[chloroform]] or [[diethyl ether|ether]]. Sweet almond oil is obtained from the dried [[seed|kernel]] of sweet almonds.

The oil is good for application to the skin as an [[emollient]], and has been traditionally used by [[massage therapist]]s to lubricate the skin during a massage session.  It is a mild, lightweight oil that can be used as a substitute for [[olive oil]].

Almond oil is also used as a wood conditioner of certain woodwind instruments, such as the oboe and clarinet.

== Nutrition and health ==
[[Image:Almond blossom aug 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Almond flowers]]

The sweet almond contains about 26% [[carbohydrates]] (12% dietary fiber, 6.3% sugars, 0.7% starch and the rest miscellaneous carbohydrates), and may therefore be made into flour for cakes and cookies (biscuits) for low-carbohydrate diets or for patients suffering from [[diabetes mellitus]] or any other form of [[glycosuria]].  Almond flour is [[gluten]]-free and therefore a popular ingredient in place of wheat flour for gluten-sensitive people and people with [[wheat allergies]] and [[coeliac disease]]. A standard serving of almond flour, 1&amp;nbsp;cup, contains 20&amp;nbsp;grams of carbohydrates, of which 10&amp;nbsp;g is [[dietary fiber]], for a net of 10&amp;nbsp;g of carbohydrate per cup.  This makes almond flour very desirable for use in cake and bread recipes by people on carbohydrate-restricted diets.

Almonds are a rich source of [[vitamin E]], containing 24&amp;nbsp;mg per 100&amp;nbsp;g.&lt;ref&gt;White, G. [http://www.allaboutvision.com/nutrition/vitamin_e.htm Vitamin E and Minerals: Nutrition from Nuts.] AllAboutVision.com. Retrieved August 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also rich in [[monounsaturated fat]], one of the two &quot;good&quot; fats responsible for lowering [[LDL cholesterol]].

Claimed health benefits of almonds include improved [[complexion]], improved movement of food through the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] (feces) and the prevention of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davis PA, Iwahashi CK |title=Whole almonds and almond fractions reduce aberrant crypt foci in a rat model of colon carcinogenesis |journal=Cancer Lett. |volume=165 |issue=1 |pages=27–33 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11248415 |doi= 10.1016/S0304-3835(01)00425-6|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304383501004256 |accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research associates the inclusion of almonds in the diet with elevating the blood levels of [[high density lipoprotein]]s and of lowering the levels of [[low density lipoprotein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Almonds: Cholesterol lowering, heart-healthy snack |publisher=[[Porter Novelli]] |year=2002 |month=September |url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2002/D/20024677.html |accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spiller GA, Jenkins DA, Bosello O, Gates JE, Cragen LN, Bruce B |title=Nuts and plasma lipids: an almond-based diet lowers LDL-C while preserving HDL-C |journal=J Am Coll Nutr |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=285–90 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=9627917 |doi= |url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9627917 |accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ayurveda]], an ancient system of health care that is native to the [[Indian subcontinent]], almond is considered a nutrient for the brain and nervous system.  It is said to induce high intellectual level and longevity.  Almond oil is called ''Roghan Badam'' in Tibb Yunani طب يوناني (the Greco-Persian system of medicine).  It is extracted by cold process, and is considered a nutritive aphrodisiac both for massage and internal consumption. Recent studies have shown that the constituents of almond have anti-inflammatory, immunity boosting, and anti-[[hepatotoxicity]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Har Sharnjit Singh |last=Puri |title=Rasayana: Ayurvedic Herbs for Longevity and Rejuvenation (Traditional Herbal Medicines for Modern Times, 2) |publisher=CRC |location=Boca Raton |year=2002 |pages=59–63 |isbn=0-415-28489-9 |chapter=Badam (''Prunus amygdalus'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study printed in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry, experts discovered that almonds contain phenolics and flavonoids (a combination of [[flavonol]]s, [[flavan-3-ol]]s, [[hydroxybenzoic acid]]s and [[flavanone]]s) in their skins&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WJH-4Y88D97-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=01%2F28%2F2010&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=ced655c324b4308bf1ea762bc71f830d Characterization of polyphenols, lipids and dietary fibre from almond skins (Amygdalus communis L.).

Almonds may cause [[food allergy|allergy]] or [[food intolerance|intolerance]]. Cross-reactivity is common with [[peach]] [[allergens]] ([[lipid transfer proteins]]) and tree [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] allergens. Symptoms range from local symptoms (e.g. [[oral allergy syndrome]], [[contact urticaria]]) to systemic symptoms including [[anaphylaxis]] (e.g. [[urticaria]], [[angioedema]], gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.food-info.net/uk/intol/almond.htm Almond allergy on Food info&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandatory pasteurization in California==
Because of two cases of [[salmonellosis]] traced to almonds in 2001 and 2004, the Almond Board of California proposed rules in 2006 regarding [[pasteurization]] of almonds available to the public, and the [[USDA]] approved them. The almond pasteurization program became mandatory for the California industry on September 1, 2007, and was implemented on a voluntary basis over the previous two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Controversially, California almonds labeled as &quot;raw&quot; are required to be steam-pasteurized or chemically treated with [[propylene oxide]]. This does not apply to imported almonds,&lt;ref&gt;[[Agricultural Marketing Service]] (2006-11-08) &quot;Almonds Grown in California: Changes to Incoming Quality Control Requirements&quot; ({{Federal Register |71 |65373}}, {{Federal Register |71 |65374}}, {{Federal Register |71 |65375}} and {{Federal Register |71 |65376}})&lt;/ref&gt; or to almonds sold from the grower directly to the consumer in small quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Nor is the treatment required for  raw almonds sold as exports to countries outside of North America.

This USDA-approved marketing order has been challenged in court by organic farmers organized by the Cornucopia Institute, a Wisconsin-based farm policy research group.  According to the Cornucopia Institute, this almond marketing order has imposed significant financial burdens on small-scale and organic growers and damaged domestic almond markets. The federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in the spring of 2009 on procedural grounds, but farmers are appealing this decision in August 2009, seeking to have the merits of their arguments heard in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{The Cornucopia Institute.

[[File:Almonds starting to grow, Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|Almonds starting to grow while flowering in the background]]
The almond is highly revered in some cultures. In northern Indian state, [[Jammu and Kashmir]], it is designated as the state tree of Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/engl/Prun_dul.html |title=Almond (''Prunus dulcis'') |accessdate=2008-07-18 |last=Katzer |first=Gernot |date=2005-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree grows in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tubeileh A, Bruggeman A, Turkelboom F |title=Growing Olives and Other Tree Species in Marginal Arid Environments |publisher=[[ICARDA]] |year=2004 |url=http://www.icarda.org/publications/price_list/book3/Book3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is mentioned numerous times in the Bible.

In the Old Testament, the almond was a symbol of watchfulness and promise due to its early flowering, symbolizing God's sudden and rapid punishment of His people; in [[Jeremiah]] 1:11–12, for instance.  In the [[Bible]] the almond is mentioned ten times, beginning with [[Book of Genesis]] 43:11, where it is described as &quot;among the best of fruits&quot;. In [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 17 [[Levi]] is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by [[Aaron's rod]], which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore sweet almonds on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the sweet almonds would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate. The almond blossom supplied a model for the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] which stood in the [[Holy Temple]], &quot;Three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers&quot;  ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25:33–34; 37:19–20). Similarly, Christian symbolism often uses almond branches as a symbol of the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]]; paintings often include almonds encircling the [[Child Jesus|baby Jesus]] and as a symbol of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]]. The word &quot;[[Luz]]&quot;, which appears in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 30:37, is sometimes translated as &quot;[[hazel]]&quot;, may actually be derived from the Aramaic name for almond (Luz), and is translated as such in some Bible versions such as the [[NIV]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=g8YSB2K9d1oC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Aramaic+almond&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bUh0oxqLD2&amp;sig=5WxT7GZydOwBr0xzulBblDuZDcE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=resultThe meaning of trees: botany, history, healing, lore]'' by Fred Hageneder, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, consumption of almonds is believed to be good for the brain, while the [[China|Chinese]] consider it a symbol of enduring sadness and female beauty{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.
