'''Afonso de Albuquerque'''[[#References|&lt;sup&gt;[p][n]&lt;/sup&gt;]] (or archaically spelt as '''Aphonso d'Albuquerque''' and also spelt as '''Affonso''', '''Alfonso''', and '''Alphonso'''; {{IPA-pt|ɐˈfõsu dɨ aɫbuˈkɛɾk}}; 1453{{ndash}}December 16, 1515) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ''[[fidalgo]]'', or nobleman, an admiral whose military and administrative activities as [[List of colonial heads of Portuguese India|second governor]] of Portuguese India conquered and established  the [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese colonial empire]] in the Indian Ocean.

He was responsible for building numerous fortresses to defend key strategic positions and establishing a net of diplomatic relations. Shortly before his death he was awarded [[viceroy]] and &quot;Duke of Goa&quot; by king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], becoming the first Portuguese duke not from the royal family, and the first Portuguese title landed overseas. For some time he was known as ''The Terrible'', ''The Great'', ''The Caesar of the East'', ''Lion of the Seas'' and as ''The Portuguese Mars''.

==Early life==
Afonso de Albuquerque was born in 1453 in [[Vila Franca de Xira|Alhandra]], near [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |coauthors=Robert Crowley &amp; Geoffrey Parker |title=Albuquerque, Afonso de | work=The Reader's Companion to Military History | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | date=December 1, 1996 | accessdate=2006-10-20  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second son of Gonçalo de Albuquerque, Lord of Vila Verde dos Francos and Dona Leonor de Menezes. His father held an important position at court and was connected by remote illegitimate descent with the Portuguese monarchy. He was educated in mathematics and Latin at the court of [[Afonso V of Portugal]], where he befriended Prince John, future king [[John II of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;Morse Stephens, &quot;Albuquerque&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 
He served ten years in [[North Africa]], where he acquired military experience. In 1471, under the command of Afonso V, he was present at the conquest of [[Tangier]] and [[Arzila]] in [[Morocco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclop&amp;aelig;dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/13157/Afonso-de-Albuquerque |title=Afonso de Albuquerque - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving there as an officer for some years. In 1476 he accompanied Prince John in wars against Castile, such as the [[Battle of Toro]]. He was in the squadron sent to the Italian Peninsula in 1480 to rescue [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]  from the [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto]] that ended in a Christian victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01270c.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Afonzo de Albuquerque |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return in 1481, when Prince John was crowned,  Albuquerque was appointed  chief [[equerry]] (''estribeiro-mor'') to the king. In 1489 he returned to service in North Africa, as commander of defense in the fortress of Graciosa, an island in the river Luco near the city of [[Larache]], and in 1490 was part of the guard of King John II, returning to Arzila in 1495 where his younger brother Martim died fighting by his side.

=== First Expedition to India, 1503 ===
{{main|5th Portuguese India Armada (Albuquerque, 1503)}}

When king [[Manuel I of Portugal]] was enthroned he showed some reticence towards Albuquerque, a close friend of his dreaded predecessor John II, and seventeen years his senior. Eighth years later, on April 6 of 1503, after a long military career and at a mature age, Afonso de Albuquerque was sent on his first expedition to [[India]] with his cousin [[Francisco de Albuquerque]]. Each commanded three ships, sailing along with [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] and [[Nicolau Coelho]]. They participated in several battles against the forces of the [[Zamorin]] of [[Calicut]] (''Calecute'',Kozhikode) and succeeded in establishing the [[Kingdom of Cochin|king]] of [[Kochi, India|Cohin]] (''Cohim'', Kochi) securely on his throne. In return, the King gave them permission to build a Portuguese [[fort Kochi|fort at Cochin]] and establish trade relations with [[Quilon]] (''Coulão'', Kollam). This laid the foundation of the Portugal's empire in the East.

=== Second Expedition to India, 1506 ===

Albuquerque returned home in July 1504, and was well received by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]]. After Albuquerque assisted with the creation of a strategy for the Portuguese efforts in the east, King Manuel entrusted him with the command of a squadron of five vessels in the fleet of sixteen sailing for [[India]] in early 1506 headed by [[Tristão da Cunha]]. Their aim was to conquer [[Socotra]] and build a fortress there, hoping to close the trade in the Red Sea. Albuquerque went as chief-captain for the &quot;[[Arabian Peninsula|Coast of Arabia]]&quot; sailing under command of da Cunha until reaching Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;Diogo do Couto, &quot;Décadas da Ásia&quot;, década X, livro I&lt;/ref&gt; He carried a sealed letter with a secret mission ordered by the king: after fulfilling the first mission he should replace the first Viceroy of India, [[Francisco de Almeida]], whose term ended two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415-1580, p. 239, Bailey Wallys Diffie, Boyd C. Shafer, George Davison Winius&lt;/ref&gt; Before departing he legitimated a natural son born in 1500 and made his will.

==== Socotra and Hormuz first conquest, 1507====
{{main|Capture of Ormuz (1507)}}
The fleet left Lisbon on April 6, 1506.  Albuquerque piloted his ship himself, having lost his appointed pilot on departure. In [[Juan de Nova Island|Mozambique Channel]] they rescued captain [[João da Nova]] who joined his ship [[Frol de la mar]] to the fleet, having been stranded on his return from Indian.&lt;ref&gt;Albuquerque, Braz de (1774).

Those included priest João Gomes, João Sanches and Tunisian Sid Mohammed who, having failed to cross the region, headed for Socotra from where Albuquerque managed to land them in [[Cape Guardafui|Filuk]].&lt;ref&gt;J.

[[File:Portuguese Castle (Hormuz).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Fort of Our Lady of the Conception in Hormoz island|Fort of Our Lady of the Conception]], [[Hormuz Island]], [[Iran]]]]
From Socotra their ways parted: Tristão da Cunha sailed for India, where he would relieve the Portuguese [[Siege of Cannanore (1507)|sieged at Cannanore]], and Albuquerque sailed with a fleet of seven ships and five hundred men in an unrequested advance towards [[Ormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], one of the eastern chief centers of commerce. On this route he conquered the cities of Curiati (Kuryat), [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] in July 1507 and [[Khor Fakkan]], accepting the submission of the cities of Kalhat and [[Sohar]]. On September 25 they arrived with a fearsome reputation at Ormuz and soon [[Capture of Ormuz (1507)|captured the city]], which agreed to become a tributary state for the Portuguese king. Few days later, the king of Ormuz was met by an envoy demanding the payment of tribute to shah [[Ismail I]] from [[Persia]]. He was sent back with the answer that the only tribute would be in canon-balls and guns, thus beginning the connection between Albuquerque and Shah Ismail I (often named Xeque Ismael).&lt;ref&gt;Molesworth Sykes,[http://books.google.com/books?id=wiAZyeSKKWwC&amp;lpg=PA271&amp;dq=ormuz%201507%20Albuquerque%20ismail&amp;pg=PA271#v=onepage&amp;q=ormuz%201507%20Albuquerque%20ismail&amp;f=false &quot;A History of Persia&quot;], p.271, READ BOOKS, 2006, ISBN 1406726923&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Brás de Albuquerque it was Xeque Ismael who coined the term &quot;Lion of the seas&quot; for Albuquerque&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately Albuquerque began building the [[Fort of Our Lady of the Conception in Hormoz island|Fort of Our Lady of Victory]] (later renamed Fort of Our Lady of the Conception).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Laraine Newhouse |last=Carter |title=Persian Gulf States: Chapter 1B.

However, some of his officers revolted against the heavy works and climate, and claiming that Albuquerque was exceeding his orders departed for India. With the fleet reduced to only two ships and left without supplies he was unable to maintain this position for long. Forced to abandon Ormuz in January 1508, he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of Socotra, returned to Ormuz and only then headed to India.

====Arrested at Cannanore, 1509====
Albuquerque arrived at [[Cannanore]] on the [[Malabarian Coast|Malabar coast]] in December 1508, where he immediately opened before the viceroy Dom [[Francisco de Almeida]] the sealed letter he had received from the king, appointing him governor.&lt;ref&gt;Afonso de Albuquerque, like many others since then, took office as Governor: when appointing the Viceroy Francisco de Almeida, the king promised not to appoint another in his lifetime, a vote of confidence in contradiction with the short term of three years he gave him, that may be due to the great fears about the sharing of power that this position represented. See ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire'', 1415-1580, p. 239, Por Bailey Wallys Diffie, Boyd C. 239, by Bailey Wallys Diffie, Boyd C. Shafer, George Davison Winius Shafer, George Davison Winius&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the first months of 1508 the son of D. Francisco de Almeida, [[Lourenço de Almeida]], died in dramatic circumstances at the [[Battle of Chaul]] and there are reports that the viceroy, an enlightened and incorruptible ruler, turned vindictive and cruel.&lt;/ref&gt;  The viceroy, then joined by the officers who had defeated Albuquerque in Ormuz, had a matching royal order, but refused to hand government, protesting that his term ended only in January and stating his intention to avenge his son's death by fighting the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|mameluk]] fleet of [[Mirocem]], refusing Albuquerque's offer to fight him himself. Afonso de Albuquerque obeyed without confronting D. Francisco de Almeida - which could have led to civil war - and moved to [[Kochi, India|Kochi]], pending on indications from the kingdom, supporting and housing his entourage himself. He was described by [[Fernão Lopes de Castanheda]] as patiently enduring an open opposition from the group that had gathered around D. Francisco de Almeida, with whom he kept formal contacts. Increasingly ostracized, he wrote to [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]], who was arriving with a new fleet to India, but was ignored as Sequeira joined the Viceroy. At the same time Albuquerque refused approaches from opponents of the viceroy, who challenged him to take power.&lt;ref&gt;Castanheda, Fernão Lopes de, &quot;[http://books.google.com.br/books?id=kcMNAAAAYAAJ&amp;hl=pt-PT História do descobrimento e conquista da Índia pelos portugueses]&quot; (Full text).&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 1509 Almeida fought the naval [[Battle of Diu]] against a joint fleet of [[Burji dynasty|Mamluks]], [[Ottomans]], the [[zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the [[Mahmud Begada|sultan of Gujarat]], taking it as personal revenge for the death of his son [[Lourenço de Almeida]] at the [[Battle of Chaul]]. His victory was decisive: Ottomans and Mamluks left the waters of the Indian Ocean, easing the Portuguese rule for over 100 years. In August, after a petition from Albuquerque's former officers with the support of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira considering him unfit for governance, he was sent in custody in an old ship to [[St. Angelo Fort]] in [[Cannanore]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Morse Stephens, &quot;Albuquerque&quot;, p.61-62, ISBN 8120615247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Whiteway, &quot;Rise of Portuguese Power in India, 1497-1550&quot; p.126, ISBN 8120605004&lt;/ref&gt; There he remained isolated, in what he considered to be under prison. In September 1509 Sequeira advanced the mission of establishing contact with the Sultan of [[Malacca]] but failed, leaving behind 19 Portuguese prisoners.

== Governor of Portuguese India, 1509-1515==
Albuquerque was released after three months' confinement, on the arrival at Cannanore of the grand-marshal of Portugal with a large fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ricardo Bonalume |last=Neto |title=Lightning rod of Portuguese India | work=MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History | publisher=Cowles Enthusiast Media Spring | date=2002-04-01 | accessdate=2006-10-20 |page=68  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the most important Portuguese noble ever to visit India and he brought an armada of fifteen ships and 3,000 men sent by the king to defend the rights of Albuquerque and take [[Calicut]].&lt;ref&gt;Neto, Ricardo Bonalume. .

In 4 November 1509 Albuquerque became the second Governor of the ''State of India'', a position he would hold until his death. Almeida having returned home in 1510,&lt;ref&gt;Almeida returned to Portugal five days later, but died in a skirmish with the [[Khoikhoi]] near the [[Cape of Good Hope]].&lt;/ref&gt; he speedily showed the energy and determination of his character.&lt;ref name=Andaya&gt;Andaya, Barbara Watson and Leonard Y. Andaya. (1984) ''A History of Malaysia'' &quot;Palgrave&quot; 376 pages. ISBN 0-312-38121-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Albuquerque intended to dominate the Muslim world and control the [[Spice trade|spices' trading network]].&lt;ref name=Andaya /&gt; 
Initially king Manuel I and his council in Lisbon tried to distribute the power, creating three areas of jurisdiction in the Indian Ocean:&lt;ref&gt;Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415-1580, p. 245-247, Diffie, Winius&lt;/ref&gt; in 1509 the nobleman [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]] was fitted with a fleet and sent to Southeast Asia, with the task of seeking an agreement with [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]] of [[Malacca]], but failed and went back to the kingdom. To Jorge de Aguiar was given the area between the Cape of Good Hope and Gujarat, he was succeeded by Duarte de Lemos but left to Cochin and then for the kingdom, leaving his fleet to Albuquerque.

===Conquest of Goa, 1510===
In January 1510, fulfilling the orders from the kingdom, and knowing of the absence of [[Zamorin]], Albuquerque advanced to [[Calicut]] (now [[Kozhikode]]). But he had to retreat after the Marshall D. Fernando Coutinho, against his warnings, ventured in the inner city fascinated by its richness, and suffered an ambush. To help him, Afonso de Albuquerque received a severe wound and had to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415-1580, p. 247, Diffie, Winius&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the failed attack on Calicut, Albuquerque hastened to form a powerful fleet of twenty-three ships and 1200 men. Contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian Mameluke Sultanate]] fleet in the Red Sea or return to Hormuz. However, he had been reported by [[Timoji]] (a privateer in the service of the Hindu [[Vijayanagara Empire]]) that it would be easier to fight them in [[Goa]], where they had sheltered after the Battle of Diu,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry p. 34-36&quot;&gt;Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry, Charles J. Borges, &quot;Goa-Kanara Portuguese relations, 1498-1763&quot; p. 34-36&lt;/ref&gt;  and also of the illness of the Sultan [[Yusuf Adil Shah]] and war between the [[Deccan sultanates]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry, Charles J. Borges, &quot;Goa-Kanara Portuguese relations, 1498-1763&quot; p. Borges, &quot;Goa-Kanara Portuguese relations, 1498-1763&quot; p. 34-36 34-36&lt;/ref&gt; So he invested by surprise in the capture of Goa to the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]]. He thus completed another mission, for Portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal &quot;guest&quot; of Kochi and had been coveting Goa as the best trading port in the region.

A first assault took place in [[Goa]] from March 4 to May 20, 1510. After a first occupation, feeling unable to handle the city - given the poor condition of its fortifications, the cooling of Hindu population support and insubordination among his rank, after a severe attack of [[Ismail Adil Shah]] - Afonso de Albuquerque refused an agreement peace by the sultan and abandoned the city in August. His fleet was shattered and a palace revolt in Kochi hindered his recovery, so he headed to [[Fort Anjediva]]. When new ships arrived from the kingdom they were intended to Malacca, for nobleman Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, who had been given a rival command of the region.

Only three months later, on November 25, Albuquerque reappeared in Goa with a fleet fully renovated, Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos vexed by his side with the reinforcements of Malacca&lt;ref&gt;Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415-1580, p. 253, Diffie, Winius 253, Diffie, Winius&lt;/ref&gt; and about 300 Malabari reinforcements from Cannanore. In less than a day they took possession of Goa from Ismail Adil Shah and his Ottoman allies, who surrendered on 10 December. It is estimated that 6000 of the 9000 Muslim defenders of the city died, either on the fierce battle in the streets or drowned while trying to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Robert (1824)&lt;/ref&gt; Albuquerque regained the support of the Hindu population, although frustrating the initial expectations of Timoja, who aspired to become governor. Afonso de Albuquerque rewarded him by appointing him chief &quot;[[Aguazil]]&quot; of the city, an administrator and representative of the Hindu and Muslim people, as a knowing interpreter of the local customs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bhagamandala Seetharama Shastry p. 34-36&quot;/&gt; He then made an agreement to lower yearly dues. 

In Goa Albuquerque started the first Portuguese [[Mint (coin)|mint]] in the East, after complaints from merchants and Timoja about the scarcity of currency, taking it as an opportunity to announce the territorial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Teotonio R. De Souza, &quot;Goa Through the Ages: An economic history&quot; p.220-221, Issue 6 of Goa University publication series, ISBN 8170222265&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Portuguese Indian rupia|coin]], based on the existing local coins, showed a cross on one side and the design of  an [[armillary sphere]] (or &quot;espera&quot;), king Manuel's badge, on the other. Gold, silver and bronze coins were issued, respectively gold cruzados or ''manueis'', ''esperas'' and ''alf-esperas'', and &quot;leais&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque&quot;, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sebastião Rodolfo Dalgado,Joseph M.

In spite of constant attacks, Goa became the center of Portuguese India, with the conquest triggering the compliance of neighboring kingdoms: the [[Sultan of Gujarat]] and the [[Zamorin]] of Calicut sent embassies, offering alliances and local grants to fortify.

===Conquest of Malacca, 1511===
{{main|Capture of Malacca (1511)}}
[[File:A famosa.jpg|thumb|The surviving gate of the [[A Famosa]] Portuguese fortress in [[Malacca]].]]
In February 1511, through a friendly Hindu merchant called Nina Chatu, Albuquerque received a letter from Rui de Araújo, one of the nineteen Portuguese arrested at Malacca since 1509. It urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their liberation, and gave details about the procedures. Albuquerque showed it to Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, as an argument to advance in a joint fleet. In April 1511, after fortifying Goa, he gathered a force of about 900 Portuguese, 200 Hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp23&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1991  | location =London  | page =23  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-333-57689-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then set sail from Goa to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]], against the orders of the kingdom and under the protest of Diogo Mendes, who claimed the command of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Afonso de Albuquerque  eventually centralized the Portuguese government in the Indian Ocean. After the conquest of Malacca he wrote a letter to the King where the reported disagreement with Diogo Mendes, suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the Portuguese in India see &quot;Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415-1580, p. 255, Diffie, Winius &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Under his orders was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who had participated in the failed embassy of [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]] in 1509.

After a false start towards the Red Sea, they sailed to the Strait of Malacca. It was the richest city that the Portuguese tried to take, and the most important east point in the trade network where Malay traders met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic, among others, described by [[Tomé Pires]] as of invaluable richness. Despite its wealth, it was mostly a wooden built city, with few masonry buildings. On the other hand it was defended by a powerful army of mercenaries and artillery, estimated at 20,000 men and more than 2000 pieces. Its greatest weakness being the unpopularity of the government of [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]], who favored Muslims producing dissatisfaction within other merchants. 

Albuquerque made a bold approach to the city, his ships decorated with banners, firing cannon volleys. He declared himself lord of all the navigation, demanding the Sultan to release the prisoners, pay for the damage, and asking to build a fortified trading post. The Sultan eventually freed the prisoners, but wasn't impressed by the small Portuguese contingent. Albuquerque then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings, to test the  response. The city being divided by the Malacca River, and connected by a bridge seen as a strategic point, on 25 July at dawn the Portuguese landed and fought in tough battle, facing poisoned arrows, taking the bridge in the evening. After waiting for the reaction of the sultan, they returned to the ships. As the sultan did not respond, they prepared a [[Junk (ship)|junk]] offered by Chinese merchants, filling it with men, artillery, sandbags. Commanded by [[António de Abreu]] it sailed the river at high tide onto the bridge, with success: the day after all had landed. Fighting fiercely, they broke down the barricades built in the meantime. Suddenly, the Sultan appeared, leading his army of war elephants to crush the invaders. Despite the surprise, one of the Portuguese, Fernão Gomes de Lemos, approached and spurred an animal with a spear, making him stand up and back. Other Portuguese emulated him and the front of elephants retreated in panic, overthrowing the army, and the sultan himself, wreaking havoc and dispersing it.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius, Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580. p. 254-260&lt;/ref&gt; During a week Albuquerque rested his men and waited for the reaction of the Sultan. Merchants approached, asking for Portuguese protection. They were given flags to mark their premises, a sign that they would not be looted. On 24 August the Portuguese attacked again, but the Sultan had fled the city. Under firm orders they looted the city, respecting the flags, which still was a fabulous drawing.

Albuquerque remained in Malacca preparing its defences against any Malay counterattack,&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp23&quot;/&gt;  immediately building a fortress, distributing his men in shifts and using stones from the mosque and the cemetery. Despite the delays caused by heat and malaria, it was completed in November 1511, its surviving door known as &quot;[[A Famosa]]&quot; ( the famous). It was possibly then that Albuquerque had a large stone engraved with the names of the participants in the conquest. As quarrel rose about the order of the names, Albuquerque had it settled turned toward the wall, with the single inscription ''Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes'' (latim for &quot;The stone the builders rejected&quot;, from prophecy of David, Psalm 118:22-23) in the front.&lt;ref&gt;Brás de Albuquerque, em [http://books.google.com/books?id=4UILAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Afonso%20de%20Albuquerque%20china&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false, Comentaries] places this episode in Malacca, although [[Gaspar Correia]] (Lendas da Índia) and [[João de Barros]] (Décadas) placed it in Goa&lt;/ref&gt;

He settled the Portuguese administration, re-appointing Rui de Araújo as [[factor (agent)|factor]], a post assigned previous his 1509 arrest, and appointing rich merchant Nina Chatu to replace the previous ''[[bendahara]]'', representative of the ''[[Kafir]]'' people and adviser. Besides assisting in the governance of the city and first Portuguese coinage, he also provided the junks for several diplomatic missions.&lt;ref&gt;Teotonio R.

===Missions from Malacca===
====Embassies to Pegu, Sumatra and Siam, 1511====
Most Muslim and Gujarati merchants having fled the city, at the same time Albuquerque invested in diplomatic efforts demonstrating a wide generosity with the merchants in Southeast Asia, like the Chinese, hoping that they echoed the good relations with the Portuguese. Trade and diplomatic missions were sent to continental kingdoms: Rui Nunes da Cunha was sent to [[Pegu]] (Burma), from were king Binyaram sent back a friendly emissary to Kochi in 1514&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Teixeira, &quot;The Portuguese missions in Malacca and Singapore (1511-1958)&quot;, Agência Geral do Ultramar, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armando Cortesão, [http://books.google.com/books?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&amp;lpg=PR81&amp;dq=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;pg=PR81#v=onepage&amp;q=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;f=false ''The Suma Oriental of Tomé Pires: an account of the east, from the Red Sea to Japan, written in Malacca and India in 1512–1515/The Book of Francisco Rodrigues rutter of a voyage in the Red Sea, nautical rules, almanack and maps, written and drawn in the east before 1515''], The Hakluyt Society, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sumatra]], Sumatran kings of Kampar and Indragiri sending emissaries to Albuquerque accepting the new power, as vassal states of Malacca.&lt;ref&gt;Donald F.

Knowing of Siamese ambitions over Malacca, Albuquerque immediately sent [[Duarte Fernandes]] in a diplomatic mission to the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (Thailand), traveling in a Chinese junk returning home. He was one of the former Portuguese arrested in Malacca, having gathered knowledge about the culture of the region. There he was the first European to arrive, establishing amicable relations between the kingdom of Portugal and the court of the King of Siam [[Ramathibodi II]], returning with a Siamese envoy with gifts and letters to Albuquerque and the king of Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Frederick Lach, Edwin J. Van Kley, &quot;Asia in the making of Europe&quot;, p.520-521, University of Chicago Press, 1994, ISBN 9780226467313&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expedition to the &quot;spice islands&quot; (Maluku islands), 1512====
[[File:Ternate.JPG|thumb| Depiction of [[Ternate]] with São João Baptista Fort, built in 1522.]]
In November, after having secured Malacca and learning the location of the then secret &quot;[[Maluku Islands|spice islands]]&quot;, Albuquerque sent an expedition of three ships sailing east to find them, led by trusted [[António de Abreu]] with the deputy commander [[Francisco Serrão]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp24&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1991  | location =London  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-333-57689-6  | page =24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] pilots were recruited to guide them through [[Java]], the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] and the [[Ambon Island]] to [[Banda Islands]], where they arrived in early 1512.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milton 1999 5 and 7&quot;&gt;Hannard (1991), page 7; {{cite book  | last =Milton  | first =Giles  | authorlink =Giles Milton  | coauthors =  | title =Nathaniel's Nutmeg  | publisher =Sceptre  | year =1999  | location =London  | pages =5 and 7  | isbn = 978-0-340-69676-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Milton 1999 5 and 7&quot;/&gt; There they remained for about a month, buying and filling their ships with [[nutmeg]] and [[cloves]]. António de Abreu then sailed to Amboina whilst Serrão stepped forward to the Moluccas but was shipwrecked near Seram. [[Sultanate of Ternate|Sultan Abu Lais of Ternate]] heard of their stranding, and, seeing a chance to ally himself with a powerful foreign nation, brought them to Ternate in 1512 were they were permitted to build a fort on the island,  {{belg|Forte de São João Baptista de Ternate|pt|Forte de São João Baptista de Ternate}}, built in 1522.

====China expeditions, 1513====
In early 1513, [[Jorge Álvares]]— sailing in a mission under Albuquerque — was allowed to land at [[Lintin Island]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]] of southern [[China]], and soon after Albuquerque sent [[Rafael Perestrello]] to southern China to seek out trade relations with the [[Ming Dynasty]] of China. In ships from [[Portuguese Malacca]], Rafael sailed to Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) in 1513 and again from 1515–1516 to trade with Chinese merchants there. These ventures, along with those of [[Tomé Pires]] and [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]], were the first direct European diplomatic and commercial ties to China.&lt;ref&gt;However, after the death of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]] on April 19, 1521, conservative factions at court seeking to limit eunuch influence rejected the new Portuguese embassy, fought sea battles with the Portuguese around [[Tuen Mun]], and Tomé was forced to write letters to Malacca stating that he and other ambassadors would not be released from prison in China until the Portuguese relinquished their control of Malacca and returned it to the deposed [[Sultan of Malacca]] (who was previously a Ming tributary vassal). See Mote, Frederick W. and Denis Twitchett. (1998). ''The Cambridge History of China; Volume 7–8''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-24333-5 (Hardback edition). Page 340. Nonetheless, Portuguese relations with China became normalized again by the 1540s and in 1557 a permanent Portuguese base at [[Macau]] in southern China was established with consent from the Ming court.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shipwreck on the ''Flor de la mar'', 1511===
In 20 November 1511 Albuquerque sailed from Malacca to the coast of Malabar on board of the old ''[[Frol de la mar]]'' [[carrack]] that had served to support the conquest of Malacca. Despite already being deemed unsafe,  Afonso de Albuquerque used her to transport the treasure amassed in the conquest, given her large capacity:&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius (1977). ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580'', p.260&lt;/ref&gt;  he wanted to give the court of King Manuel I a show of Malaccan treasures. There were also the offers from the [[Kingdom of Siam]] (Thailand) to the king of Portugal and all his own fortune. On the voyage a storm arose and the ''[[Flor De La Mar]]'' was wrecked, and he himself barely escaped with his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp23&quot;/&gt; 

Albuquerque returned from Malacca to Kochi, but could not sail to Goa as it faced a serious revolt headed by the forces of [[Ismael Adil Shah]], the Sultan of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]], commanded by [[Rasul Khan]] with the help of some of his countrymen. While he was absent in Malacca, Portuguese who opposed the taking of Goa had waived the possession, even written to the king stating that it would be best to let it go. Prevented to sail by the monsoon and with few forces available, he had to wait for the arrival of reinforcement fleets headed by his nephew D. Garcia de Noronha and Jorge de Mello Pereira. 

On 10 September 1512, Albuquerque set sail from Cochin to Goa with fourteen ships carrying 1,700 soldiers. Determined to recapture the fortress, he ordered trenches to be dug and a wall to be breached. But on the very morning of the planned final assault, Rasul Khan surrendered. Albuquerque demanded the fort to be handed with all its artillery, ammunition and horses, and the deserters to be given up. Some had joined Rasul Khan when the Portuguese were forced to flee Goa in May 1510, others during the recent siege. Rasul Khan consented, on condition that their lives be spared. Albuquerque agreed and he left Goa. Albuquerque kept his word, but mutilated them horribly. One of such renegades was [[Fernão Lopez]], bound for Portugal in custody, who escaped at the island of Saint Helena leading a 'Robinson Crusoe' life for many years. After such measures the town became the most flourishing of the Portuguese settlements in India.

=== Return to the Red Sea, 1513===
In December 1512 an envoy from [[Ethiopia]] arrived at Goa. [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Mateus]] was sent by regent queen [[Eleni of Ethiopia|Eleni]] following the arrival of the Portuguese from Socotra in 1507, as an ambassador for the king of Portugal in search of a coalition to help face growing Ottoman influence. He was received in Goa with great honor by Albuquerque, as a long sought &quot;[[Prester John]]&quot; envoy. His arrival was announced by king [[Manuel I of Portugal]] to [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513. Although Mateus faced the distrust of some of Albuquerque rivals, who tried to prove he was some impostor or Muslim spy, Albuquerque sent him to Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Millet Rogers, [http://books.google.com/books?id=lBh--X3QjnsC&amp;lpg=1 &quot;The quest for Eastern Christians: travels and rumor in the Age of Discovery&quot;, p. 134], U of Minnesota Press, 1962, ISBN 0816602751&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The king is described as having wept with joy at their view.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 1513, while Mateus was in Portugal, Albuquerque sailed to the [[Red Sea]] with a force of about 1000 Portuguese and 400 Malabaris. He was, from the start, under orders from the kingdom to secure that channel to Portugal. Barren Socotra had proved ineffective to control the Red Sea entrance and was abandoned, and Albuquerque's hint that [[Massawa]] could be a good Portuguese base may have been influenced by Mateus' reports.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius (1977). [http://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&amp;lpg=1 ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580'', p.352]. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. ISBN 0816607826&lt;/ref&gt; 

Knowing that [[mameluks]] were preparing a second fleet at [[Suez]], he wanted to advance before reinforcements arrived to [[Aden]]. He accordingly laid siege to the city.&lt;ref&gt;By M. D. D. Newitt, [http://books.google.com/books?id=vpteLQcx6J4C&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=Albuquerque%20Aden%20Red%20sea&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q=Albuquerque%20Aden%20Red%20sea&amp;f=false &quot;A history of Portuguese overseas expansion, 1400-1668&quot;], p.87, Routledge, 2005, ISBN 0415239796&lt;/ref&gt; Aden was a fortified city, but although having scaling ladders they broke and after half day of fierce battle Albuquerque forces were forced to retreat. They cruised the Red Sea inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], as the first European fleet to have sailed this waters. Albuquerque attempted to reach [[Jeddah]], but the winds were unfavorable and so sheltered at [[Kamaran]] island in May, until sickness among the men and lack of fresh water forced to retreat. In August 1513, after a second attempt to reach Aden, they returned to India with no substantial results. In order to destroy the power of [[Egypt]], Albuquerque is said to have entertained the idea of diverting the course of the [[Nile River]] and so rendering the whole country barren. Perhaps most tellingly, he intended to steal the body of the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]], and hold it for ransom until all Muslims had left the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew James McGregor, &quot;A military history of modern Egypt: from the Ottoman Conquest to the Ramadan War&quot;, p.20, Greenwood Publishing Group, ISBN 9780275986018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Afonso Braz de Albuquerque, &quot;Commentaries of the Great Afonso Dalboquerque, Second Viceroy of India&quot;, Vol. 4 , Walter de Gray Birch (Translator), ISBN 9781402195082&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administration and diplomacy in Goa, 1514===
[[File:Dürer rhino full.png|thumb|left|[[Dürer's Rhinoceros]], [[woodcut]], 1515.]]
In [[1514]] Afonso de Albuquerque was devoted to the administration and diplomacy in Goa, concluding peace with Calicut and receiving embassies from Indian governors, strengthening the city and stimulating the marriage of Portuguese with local women. At that time, Portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas due to superstition about women on ships, as well as the substantial danger of the sea route. In 1511, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women, under a policy set by Albuquerque. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or &quot;married men&quot;) who ventured overseas and married local women. With Albuquerque's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished. He appointed local people for positions in the Portuguese administration and didn't interfere with local traditions, except the &quot;[[Sati (practice)|sati]]&quot;, the practice of immolating widows, which he forbade.

In March 1514 King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had sent to [[Pope Leo X]] a huge and exotic embassy led by [[Tristão da Cunha]], who toured the streets of Rome in a extravagant procession of animals from the colonies and wealth from the Indies that struck Europe. His reputation reached its peak, creating the foundation of the Portuguese Empire in the East. 
In early 1514, Afonso de Albuquerque had sent ambassadors to Sultan [[Muzafar II]], ruler of [[Cambay]], to seek permission to build a fort on [[Diu]].  The mission returned without an agreement, but diplomatic gifts were exchanged, including an [[Indian Rhinoceros|Indian rhinoceros]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, p.112.&lt;/ref&gt; Albuquerque forward the gift, named ''ganda'', and its Indian keeper, Ocem, to King Manuel I.&lt;ref name=&quot;lambe&quot;&gt;[http://www.artebr.com/lambelambe/historia.html História do famoso rhinocerus de Albrecht Dürer], Projecto Lambe-Lambe {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1515, the king sent it as a gift for [[Pope Leo X]], but it died in a shipwreck off the coast of [[Italy]] in early 1516. [[Germany|German]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Albrecht Dürer]], based on a written description and brief sketch by an unknown artist, created then is famous [[Dürer's Rhinoceros]] in 1515.&lt;ref&gt;Some sources erroneously say 1513, copying a typographical error made by Dürer in one of his original drawings and perpetuated in his woodcut.&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer never saw the actual rhinoceros, which was the first living example seen in Europe since [[Roman Empire|Roman times]].

=== Conquest of Ormuz and last days, 1515===
In 1513 at Cannanore Albuquerque was visited by a [[Persia]]n ambassador from shah [[Ismail I]], who had sent ambassadors to Gujarat, Ormuz and Bijapur. The [[shah]]'s ambassador to Bijapur visited Albuquerque inviting him to send back an envoy to Persia. Miguel Ferreira was sent via Ormuz to [[Tabriz]], were he had several interviews with the Shah about common goals on defeating the Mameluke sultan. 

Having returned with rich presents and an ambassador, on the journey back in March 1515 they were met by Albuquerque at [[Ormuz]], where he went to [[Capture of Ormuz (1507)|establish his rule]].&lt;ref&gt;John Holland Rose, Arthur Percival Newton, Ernest Alfred Benians, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Y-08AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Albuquerque%20Aden%20Persia&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=Albuquerque%20Aden%20Persia&amp;f=false &quot;The Cambridge history of the British empire, Volume 2&quot;, p. 12], CUP Archive, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; Fueled by the offers of the sha, Albuquerque had advanced in his desire to recapture Hormuz alone. He had learned that after the Portuguese retreat in 1507, a young king was reigning under the influence of a powerful Persian [[vizier]], Reis Hamed, which the king greatly feared. At Hormuz, Albuquerque had a parley with the king and asked the vizier to be present. He then had him immediately stabbed and killed by his entourage, thus &quot;freeing&quot; the frighted king so the island in the Persian Gulf yielded to him without resistance, and remained a Portuguese vassal state until 1622. There Albuquerque stood, engaging in diplomatic efforts and receiving envoys while becoming increasingly ill. In November 1515 he decided to return, but he didn't survived to land, having died off Goa.

====Political downfall====
Albuquerque's career had a painful and ignominious close. He had several enemies at the Portuguese court who lost no opportunity of stirring up the jealousy of King Manuel against him, insinuating that he intended to strike power in Portuguese India, and his own injudicious and arbitrary conduct on several occasions served their end only too well. 

On his return from Ormuz, at the entrance of the harbour of Goa, he got news about a fleet arriving from Europe bearing dispatches announcing that he was superseded by his personal enemy [[Lopo Soares de Albergaria]]. The blow was too much for him and he died at sea on December 16, 1515.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Rinehart |title=Portugal: Chapter 2B. The Expansion of Portugal | work=Countries of the World | publisher=Bureau Development, Inc. | date=January 1, 1991 | accessdate=2006-10-20  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death Albuquerque dictated a letter to King Manuel I in dignified and affecting terms, vindicating his conduct and claiming for his [[natural son]] the honors and rewards that were justly due to himself.  

Albergaria had departed from Lisbon in 7 April 1515, along with Mateus and a returning embassy to Ethiopia. Yet in August, through contacts in Venice, King Manuel I learned that the Mamluk Sultan of Cairo had prepared a fleet at Suez with men and artillery to fight the Portuguese in India and, especially, in Hormuz. Fearing the effects and repented to have replaced Albuquerque, he immediately wrote to Albergaria to return the command of all operations to Albuquerque, and to provide him with resources so that he could fight the rival forces. However when the letter arrived, Albuquerque had already died.&lt;ref&gt;Albuquerque, Brás de (1774). [http://books.google.com/books?id=R2YWhpecZEQC&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=king%20manuel%20repent%20Albuquerque&amp;pg=PA200#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque, parte IV&quot;], p.200-206&lt;/ref&gt; His body was buried in Goa according to his will, in the Church of Nossa Senhora da Serra (Our Lady of the Hill), built in 1513 thanking for his escape from [[Kamaran]] island.&lt;ref&gt;This Church was later demolished between 1811 and 1842, in Manoel José Gabriel Saldanha, &quot;História de Goa:(política e arqueológica)&quot;, p.145, ISBN 812060590X&lt;/ref&gt; After 51 years, in 1566, he was moved to Nossa Senhora da Graça church in Lisbon,&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliotheca Lusitana'', Diogo Barbosa Machado, Tomo I, página 23&lt;/ref&gt; which was ruined and rebuilt after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755 earthquake]].

==Legacy==
[[Image:Monument to Afonso de Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|right|Albuquerque Monument on [[Afonso de Albuquerque Square]] in Lisbon (1902).]]
King Manuel I of Portugal was convinced too late of Albuquerque's loyalty, and endeavoured to atone for the ingratitude with which he had treated him by heaping honours upon his son, [[Brás de Albuquerque]] (1500—1580).,&lt;ref&gt;Stier, Hans Erich (1942) ''Die Welt als Geschichte: Zeitschrift für Universalgeschichte'' &quot;W. Kohlhammer&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; whom he renamed &quot;Afonso&quot; in memory of his father.  

Afonso de Albuquerque was a prolific writer, having written numerous letters to the king reporting all kind of matters during his governorship, from minor issues to major strategies. In 1557 his son  published a collection his letters under the title ''Commentarios do Grande Affonso d'Alboquerque''.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Jack D. (1993) ''Africans and Native Americans'' &quot;University of Illinois Press&quot;. 344 pages. ISBN 0-252-06321-X.&lt;/ref&gt;- a clear reference to [[Caesar's Commentaries]]- which he later reviewed and re-published in 1576. There Albuquerque was described as &quot;a man of middle stature, with a long face, fresh colored, the nose somewhat large. He was a prudent man, and a Latin scholar, and spoke in elegant phrases; his conversation and writings showed his excellent education. He was of ready words, very authoritative in his commands, very circumspect in his dealings with the Moors, and greatly feared yet greatly loved by all, a quality rarely found united in one captain. He was very valiant and favored by fortune.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Albuquerque, Brás, Commentaries, vol VI, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1572]] Albuquerque's feats were inscribed in ''[[The Lusiads]]'', the Portuguese main [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[Luís de Camões|Luís Vaz de Camões]] (Canto X, strophe 40 to 49), were the poet praises his achievements but has the [[muses]] frown upon the harsh rule towards his own men, of whom Camões was almost a contemporary fellow. In 1934 Albuquerque was celebrated by [[Fernando Pessoa]] in ''Mensagem'', a symbolist epic. In the first part of this work, called &quot;Brasão&quot; (Coat-of-Arms), he relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields in the Portuguese coat-of-arms, Albuquerque being one of the wings of the [[griffin]] headed by Henry the navigator, the other wing being king John II. 

An exquisite and expensive variety of mango, that he used to bring on his journeys to India, has been named in his honour, and is today sold throughout the world as [[Alphonso (mango)|Alphonso mangoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Alphonso mangoes | work=Savani Farms | url=http://www.savanifarms.com/ | accessdate=2006-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his fame, the city of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] in New Mexico is not named after him.  It was named after a Spanish Viceroy of Mexico named Don [[Francisco Fernández de la Cueva]], who also held the title [[Duke of Alburquerque]].  There is, however, a town near the Spanish-Portuguese border named [[Alburquerque, Badajoz|Alburquerque]] which may be the root of both names.
Additionally, it is highly likely that one of the major thoroughfares in Malacca's Portuguese Settlement, Jalan D'Albuquerque, is named after Afonso de Albuquerque.
