[[Image:BlackForest-Position.svg|thumb|A [[map]] of [[Germany]], showing the Black Forest in [[green]].]]
The '''Black Forest''' ({{lang-de|[[:de:Schwarzwald|Schwarzwald]]}}) is a [[forest|wooded]] [[mountain range]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]], southwestern [[Germany]]. It is bordered by the [[Rhine]] valley to the west and south. The highest peak is the [[Feldberg (Black Forest)|Feldberg]] with an elevation of 1,493 metres (4,898&amp;nbsp;ft). 
The region is almost rectangular with a length of {{km to mi|200|abbr=yes|precision=-1}} and breadth of {{km to mi|60|abbr=yes}}. Hence it has an area of approximately {{km2 to mi2|12000|abbr=yes|precision=-2}}.  The name ''Schwarzwald'', i.e. Black Forest, goes back to the Romans who referred to the thickly forested mountains there as ''Silva Nigra'' , i.e. &quot;Black Forest,&quot; because the dense growth of conifers in the forest blocked out most of the light inside the forest.

==Geology==
The Black Forest consists of a cover of [[sandstone]] on top of a core of [[gneiss]] and [[granite]]s. Formerly it shared tectonic evolution with the nearby [[Vosges Mountains]]. Later during the Middle [[Eocene]] a [[rifting]] period affected the area and caused formation of the [[Rhine graben]]. During the last [[glacial period]] of the [[Würm glaciation]], the Black Forest was covered by glaciers; several [[Tarn (lake)|tarns (or lakes)]] such as the Mummelsee are remains of this period.

==Rivers==
Rivers in the Black Forest include the [[Danube]] (which originates in the Black Forest as the confluence of the [[Brigach]] and [[Breg (river)|Breg]] rivers), the [[Enz]], the [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzig]], the [[Murg]], the [[Nagold River|Nagold]], the [[Neckar]], the [[Rench]], and the Wiese. The Black Forest is part of the [[continental divide]] between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] [[drainage basin]] (drained by the [[Rhine]]) and the [[Black Sea]] drainage basin (drained by the Danube).

* [[Herzogenhorn]] ({{convert|1415|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Belchen]] ({{convert|1414|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Spiesshorn]] ({{convert|1349|m|abbr=on}})

* [[Hochblauen]] ({{convert|1165|m|abbr=on}})
* [[Hornisgrinde]] ({{convert|1164|m|abbr=on}})

==Political==
Administratively, the Black Forest belongs completely to the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and comprises the city of [[Pforzheim]] as well as the following districts (''[[Districts of Germany|Kreise]]''). In the north: [[Enz (district)|Enz]], [[Rastatt (district)|Rastatt]] and [[Calw (district)|Calw]]; in the middle: [[Freudenstadt (district)|Freudenstadt]], [[Ortenaukreis]] and [[Rottweil (district)|Rottweil]]; in the south: [[Emmendingen (district)|Emmendingen]], [[Schwarzwald-Baar]], [[Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald]], [[Lörrach (district)|Lörrach]] and [[Waldshut (district)|Waldshut]].

==Ecology and economy==
The forest mostly consists of [[pine]]s and [[fir]]s, some of which are grown in commercial [[monoculture]]. Similar to other forested regions, the Black Forest has had areas that were decimated by mass [[logging]]. Due to logging and land use changes the forest proper is only a fraction of its original size. The storm [[Lothar (storm)|Lothar]] downed trees on hundreds of acres of mountaintops in 1999. This left some of the high peaks and scenic hills bare, with only primary growth shrubs and young fir trees.

The main industry is [[tourism]]. In addition to the towns and monuments noted below, the Black Forest is crossed by numerous [[long distance footpath]]s, including some of the first to be established. The [[European long-distance path]] [[European walking route E1|E1]] crosses the Black Forest following the routes of some of the local long-distance paths. There are numerous shorter paths suitable for day walks, as well as [[mountain biking]] and [[cross-country skiing]] trails. The total network of tracks amounts to around {{convert|23000|km}}, and is maintained and overseen by a voluntary body, the ''[[Schwarzwaldverein]]'' (Black Forest Society), which has around 90,000 members (figures from Bremke, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;9).

==Points of interest==

There are many old towns in the Black Forest. Popular tourist destinations include [[Freiburg]], [[Calw]] (the birth town of [[Hermann Hesse]]), [[Gengenbach]], [[Staufen, Germany|Staufen]], [[Schiltach]], [[Haslach]] and [[Altensteig]]. Other popular destinations include such mountains as the Feldberg, the [[Belchen]], the [[Kandel (Black Forest)|Kandel]], and the Schauinsland; the [[Titisee]] and [[Schluchsee]] lakes; the [[All Saints Waterfalls]]; the [[Triberg Waterfalls]], not the highest, but the most famous waterfalls in Germany; and the [[canyon|gorge]] of the River [[Wutach (river)|Wutach]].

The [[Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof]] is an open-air museum that shows the life of sixteenth or seventeenth century farmers in the region, featuring a number of reconstructed Black Forest farms. The [[Deutsches Uhrenmuseum|German Clock Museum]] in [[Furtwangen im Schwarzwald|Furtwangen]] shows the history of the [[clock]] industry and of [[watch]]makers.

For drivers, the main route through the region is the rapid A5 (E35) motorway, but a variety of sign-posted scenic routes such as the Schwarzwald-Hochstrasse ({{convert|60|km|abbr=on}}, [[Baden-Baden]] to [[Freudenstadt]]), Schwarzwald Tälerstrasse ({{convert|100|km|abbr=on}}, the [[Murg]] and [[Kinzig (Rhine)|Kinzig]] valleys) or Badische Weinstrasse (Baden Wine Street, {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}}, a wine route from [[Baden-Baden]] to [[Weil am Rhein]]) offers calmer driving along high roads. [http://travel.independent.co.uk/europe/article97082.ece] The last is a picturesque trip starting in the south of the Black Forest going north and includes numerous old wineries and tiny villages. Another, more specialized route is the 'Deutsche Uhrenstraße' (&quot;German Clock Road&quot;), [http://www.deutsche-uhrenstrasse.de/sofindensieunsen.htm] a circular route which traces the [[horology|horological]] history of the region.

Due to the rich mining history dating from medieval times (the Black Forest was one of the most important mining regions of Europe circa 1100) there are many mines re-opened to the public. Such mines may be visited in the Kinzig valley, the Suggental, the Muenster valley, and around Todtmoos.

The Black Forest was visited on several occasions by Count [[Otto von Bismarck]] during his rule 1873-1890. Allegedly, he especially was interested in the [[Triberg Waterfalls]]. [http://books.google.com/books?id=GOwOyUl7-TMC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=bismarck+triberg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o0tRfEUt2Z&amp;sig=EddXNLXfR1TCIzsN2HxkV2MnM_4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result] There is now a monument in Triberg dedicated to Bismarck, who apparently enjoyed the tranquility of the region, which was lacking at his residence in Berlin.

==Fauna==
In addition to the expected kinds of wildlife to be found in a European forest area, the following types of animals may be observed in the Black Forest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackforest-tourism.com/index.php/layout/set/print/sprachversionen/natur/natur_mit_allen_sinnen_wahrnehmen__1 Enjoy nature with all the senses / Nature / Home / Inhalte - Schwarzwald Tourismus GmbH&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these animals include

*Cattle: The Black Forest cattle belong to the rare breed of &quot;Hinterwälderberg&quot; cattle
*The giant earthworm ''[[Lumbricus badensis]]'' is found only in the Black Forest region&lt;ref&gt;Lamparski, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Black Forest Foxes'' are a breed of [[horse]], previously indispensable for heavy field work
*[[Eagle]]s and [[owl]]s can be seen at close range

==Culture==
Dialects spoken in the Black Forest area are [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] and [[Swabian German|Swabian]].

===Fasnet===
The German holiday of [[Fastnacht]], or Fasnet, as it is known in the Black Forest region, occurs in the time leading up to [[Lent]]. On [[Rosenmontag]], or the Monday before Ash Wednesday, crowds of people line the streets, wearing masks. One prominent style of mask is called the Black Forest Style, originating from the Black Forest Region.

===Crafts===
[[Wood-carving]] is a traditional cottage industry in the region and carved ornaments now are produced in substantial numbers as souvenirs for tourists. [[Cuckoo clock]]s are a popular example; they have been made in the region since the early eighteenth century and much of their development occurred there.

===Culinary===
[[Black Forest ham]] originated from this region, and so, by name and reputation at least, did the [[Black Forest Cake]]. It also is known as the &quot;Black Forest Cherry Cake&quot; or &quot;Black Forest Gateau&quot; and is made with chocolate cake, cream, sour cherries and [[Kirsch]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europeancuisines.com/German-Schwarzwalder-Kirschtorte-Recipe-Black-Forest-Cake-Cherry-Kirsch&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Forest variety of ''[[Tarte flambée|Flammkuchen]]'' is a Badisch specialty made with ham, cheese and cream. ''[[Pancake|Pfannkuchen]]'', a [[crêpe]] or [[Pancake#Regional varieties|crêpe-like]] ([[:de:Eierkuchen|''Eierkuchen'']] or ''[[Palatschinken]]'') pastry, is also common.
