Humans have a [[encephalization|highly developed]] [[human brain|brain]], capable of abstract [[reasoning]], [[language]], [[introspection]], and [[problem solving]]. This mental capability, combined with an erect body carriage that frees the hands for manipulating objects, has allowed humans to make far greater use of [[tool]]s than any other living species on Earth. Other higher-level thought processes of humans, such as [[self-awareness]], [[rationality]], and [[sapience]],&lt;ref name=mc2&gt;''Dependent Rational Animals: Why Human Beings Need the Virtues'' By [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] pp. 60, &quot;But this [language] is insufficient for human rationality, What is needed in addition is the ability to construct sentences that contain as constituents either the sentences use to express the judgment about which the agent is reflecting, or references to those sentences.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcd&gt;[[John McDowell]], ''Mind and World'', 1994. p.115, Harvard University Press, (quoted in ''Dependent Rational Animals'', by Alasdair MacIntyre): &quot;In mere animals, sentience is in the service of a mode of life that is structured exclusively by immediate biological imperatives&quot; [..] &quot;merely animal life is shaped by goals whose control of the animal's behavior at a given moment is an immediate outcome of biological forces&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flanagan&quot;&gt;''The Really Hard Problem:Meaning in a Material World'', [[Owen Flanagan]], MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; are considered to be defining features of what constitutes a &quot;[[person]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=mc1&gt;''Dependent Rational Animals: Why Human Beings Need the Virtues'' By [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] pp. 60, &quot;Those who have wanted to draw a single sharp line between human and nonhuman animals have commonly laid emphasis upon the presence or absence of language as such, the ability to use and to respond to strings of syntactically ordered and semantically significant expressions whose utterance constitutes speech acts.

Like most [[simian|higher primates]], humans are [[social animal]]s. Humans are uniquely adept at utilizing systems of communication for self-expression, the exchange of ideas, and organization. Humans create complex [[social structure]]s composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from [[family|families]] to [[nation]]s. [[Social interaction]]s between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values, [[norm (sociology)|social norms]], and rituals, which together form the basis of human society. With individuals widespread in every continent except [[Antarctica]], humans are a [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] species. In January 2011, the human [[world population|population]] was estimated to be about 6.91 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;popclock&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Humans are noted for their desire to understand and influence their environment, seeking to explain and manipulate phenomena through [[science]], [[philosophy]], [[mythology]], and [[religion]]. This natural curiosity has led to the development of advanced tools and skills, which are passed down [[culture|culturally]]; humans are the only species known to build [[fire]]s, [[cooking|cook their food]], [[clothing|clothe]] themselves, and use numerous other [[technology|technologies]]. The study of humans is the scientific discipline of [[anthropology]].

==Etymology==
{{See|Man (word)|List of alternative names for the human species}}
The English adjective ''human'' is a [[Middle English]] [[loanword]] from [[Old French]] ''{{lang|fro|humain}}'', ultimately from [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|hūmānus}}'', the adjective form of ''{{lang|la|homō}}'' &quot;man&quot;. The word's use as a noun (with a plural: ''humans'') dates to the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], [[sub verbo|s.v.]] &quot;human&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The native English term ''[[Man (word)|man]]'' is now often reserved for male adults, but the term &quot;mankind&quot; is occasionally used to refer to the species generally in Modern English. This use is considered by many to be obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;The [[OED]]
considers ''obsolete'' the sense &quot;a designation applied equally to particular individuals of either sex&quot;, citing a 1597 source as the most recent (''The Lord had but one paire of men in Paradise.'') while it continues to endorse the sense &quot;as a general or indefinite designation&quot; as current in English.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem|*[[mannaz]]}}'', from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) root ''{{PIE|*man-}}'', a [[cognate]] to Sanskrit ''[[Manu (Hinduism)|manu]]-''.

The [[Name of a biological genus|generic name]] ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' is a learned 18th century derivation from Latin ''{{lang|la|homō}}'' &quot;man&quot;, ultimately &quot;earthly being&quot; ([[Old Latin]] ''{{lang|la|hemō}}'', a [[cognate]] to Old English ''{{lang|ang|guma}}'' &quot;man&quot;, from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''{{PIE|*dʰǵʰ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;mon-}}'', meaning 'earth' or 'ground').&lt;ref&gt;[[IEW|Porkorny (1959)]] s.v. &quot;g'hðem&quot; pp. 414–416; &quot;Homo.&quot; Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1).

Scientific study of [[human evolution]] is concerned, primarily, with the development of the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', but usually involves studying other [[hominidae|hominids]] and [[homininae|hominines]] as well, such as ''[[Australopithecus]]''. &quot;Modern humans&quot; are defined as the ''Homo sapiens'' [[species]], of which the only extant [[subspecies]] is known as ''Homo sapiens sapiens''. ''[[Homo sapiens idaltu]]'' (roughly translated as &quot;elder wise human&quot;), the other known subspecies, is now extinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/projects/human/# Human evolution: the fossil evidence in 3D], by Philip L.

Anatomically modern humans first appear in the fossil record in Africa about 195,000 years ago, and studies of molecular biology give evidence that the approximate time of divergence from the common ancestor of all modern human populations was 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=102968 nsf.gov - National Science Foundation (NSF) News - New Clues Add 40,000 Years to Age of Human Species - US National Science Foundation (NSF)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The evolutionary history of [[primate]]s can be traced back 65 million years. Primates are one of the oldest of all surviving placental mammal groups. The oldest known primate-like mammal species (those of the genus ''[[Plesiadapis]]'') come from North America, but inhabited Eurasia and Africa on a wide scale during the tropical conditions of the [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]]. Molecular evidence suggests that the last common ancestor between humans and the remaining great apes diverged 4–8 million years ago.

The [[gorilla]]s were the first group to split, then the chimpanzees (genus ''Pan'') split off from the line leading to the humans. The [[gene|functional portion of human DNA]] is approximately 98.4% identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (see [[human evolutionary genetics]]). Therefore, the closest living relatives of humans are [[gorilla]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s, as they share a relatively recent [[common ancestor]].&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wood B, Richmond BG |title=Human evolution: taxonomy and paleobiology |journal=J.

Human evolution is characterised by a number of important changes—morphological, developmental, physiological, and behavioural—which have taken place since the split between the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. The first major morphological change was the evolution of a [[bipedalism|bipedal locomotor]] adaptation from an [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreal or semi-arboreal]] one,&lt;ref&gt;Vančata1 V., &amp; Vančatová, M. A. &quot;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/h514455w35006v4n/ Major features in the evolution of early hominoid locomotion]&quot;. Springer Netherlands, Volume 2, Number 6, December 1987. pp.517–537.&lt;/ref&gt; with all its attendant adaptations (a [[Valgus deformity|valgus]] knee, low [[intermembral index]] (long legs relative to the arms), reduced upper-body strength).

The human species developed a much larger brain than that of other primates – typically 1,400&amp;nbsp;cm³ in modern humans, over twice the size of that of a chimpanzee or gorilla. The pattern of human postnatal brain growth differs from that of other apes ([[heterochrony]]), and allows for extended periods of social learning and [[language acquisition]] in juvenile humans. [[Physical anthropology|Physical anthropologists]]{{Who|date=July 2010}} argue that the differences between the structure of [[human brain]]s and those of other apes are even more significant than their differences in size.

Other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a [[Thumb#Grips|power and precision grip]],&lt;ref&gt;Brues, Alice M. &amp; Snow, Clyde C. &quot;Physical Anthropology&quot;. ''Biennial Review of Anthropology'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;4, 1965. pp.&amp;nbsp;1–39.&lt;/ref&gt; a reduced masticatory system, a reduction of the [[canine tooth]], and the descent of the [[larynx]] and [[hyoid bone]], making speech possible. An important physiological change in humans was the evolution of hidden oestrus, or [[concealed ovulation]], which may have coincided with the evolution of important behavioural changes, such as pair bonding. Another significant behavioural change was the development of [[material culture]], with human-made objects becoming increasingly common and diversified over time. The relationship between all these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Robert &amp; Silk, Joan B. (2003). ''How Humans Evolved''. New York: Norton &amp; Company.

''Anthropology and the natural sciences-The problem of human evolution'', ''Current Anthropology '4'' (2): 138–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

The forces of [[natural selection]] have continued to operate on human populations, with evidence that certain regions of the genome display [[directional selection]] in the past 15,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/07/science/07evolve.html|access_date=2008-07-02 | title = Still Evolving, Human Genes Tell New Story | last =Wade | first = N | date = 2006-03-07 | accessdate = 2008-07-10 | publisher = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anatomically modern humans]] evolved from [[archaic Homo sapiens|archaic ''Homo sapiens'']] in Africa in the [[Middle Paleolithic]], about 200,000 years ago. By the beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (50,000 [[Before Present|BP [Before Present]]]), full [[behavioral modernity]], including [[origin of language|language]], [[origin of music|music]] and other [[cultural universal]]s had developed.

The [[Recent African origin of modern humans|out of Africa]] migration is estimated to have occurred about 70,000 years BP.

===Transition to civilization===
{{Main|Neolithic revolution|Cradle of Civilization}}
{{See|History of the world}}
[[Image:Farmer plowing.jpg|thumb|250px|The rise of [[agriculture]], and [[domestication]] of animals, led to stable [[human settlements]].]]
[[File:Human spreading over history.png|thumb|right|250px|The path followed by humans in the course of history]]

Until c.&amp;nbsp;10,000 years ago, most humans lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They generally lived in small nomadic groups known as [[band societies]]. The advent of agriculture prompted the [[Neolithic Revolution]], when access to food surplus led to the formation of permanent human settlements, the [[domestication]] of animals and the [[Chalcolithic|use of metal tools]] for the first time in history. Agriculture encouraged trade and cooperation, and led to complex society. Because of the significance of this date for human society, it is the epoch of the [[Holocene calendar]] or Human Era.

About 6,000 years ago, the first proto-states developed in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]]'s [[Nile Valley]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valleys]]. Military forces were formed for protection, and government bureaucracies for administration. States cooperated and competed for resources, in some cases waging wars. Around 2,000–3,000 years ago, some states, such as [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[History of India|India]], [[China]], [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and [[Macedonian Empire|Greece]], developed through conquest into the first expansive empires. Influential religions, such as [[Judaism]], originating in [[West Asia]], and [[Hinduism]], a religious tradition that originated in South Asia, also rose to prominence at this time.

The late [[Middle Ages]] saw the rise of revolutionary ideas and technologies. In China, an advanced and urbanized society promoted innovations and sciences, such as printing and seed drilling. In India, major advancements were made in mathematics, philosophy, religion and metallurgy. The [[Islamic Golden Age]] saw major scientific advancements in [[Islam|Muslim]] empires. In Europe, the rediscovery of [[classical antiquity|classical]] learning and inventions such as the printing press led to the [[Renaissance]] in the 14th and 15th centuries. Over the next 500&amp;nbsp;years, [[Age of Discovery|exploration]] and [[colonialism]] brought great parts of the world under European control, leading to later struggles for independence. The [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 17th century and the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 18th–19th centuries promoted major innovations in transport, such as the railway and automobile; [[energy development]], such as coal and electricity; and government, such as [[representative democracy]] and [[Communism]].

With the advent of the [[Information Age]] at the end of the 20th century, modern humans live in a world that has become increasingly [[globalization|globalized]] and interconnected. As of 2010, almost 2 billion humans are able to communicate with each other via the [[Internet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm |title=Internet Usage Statistics - The Internet Big Picture |publisher=internetworldstats.com/ |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.3 billion by [[mobile phone]] subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.reuters.co.uk/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=media&amp;storyID=nL29172095 |title=Reuters homepage |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although interconnection between humans has encouraged the growth of [[science]], [[art]], [[discussion]], and [[technology]], it has also led to culture clashes and the development and use of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Human civilization has led to environmental destruction and pollution, producing an ongoing [[mass extinction]] of other forms of life called the [[holocene extinction event]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pimm S, Raven P, Peterson A, Sekercioglu CH, Ehrlich PR |title=Human impacts on the rates of recent, present, and future bird extinctions |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0604181103 |journal=Proc.

[[Image:Indian family in Brazil posed in front of hut.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Humans often live in family-based social structures and create artificial shelter.]]

Early [[human settlements]] were dependent on proximity to [[water resources|water]] and, depending on the [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], other [[natural resources]] used for [[subsistence]], such as populations of animal prey for [[hunting]] and [[arable land]] for growing crops and grazing [[livestock]]. But humans have a great capacity for altering their [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] by means of technology; through [[irrigation]], [[urban planning]], [[construction]], [[transport]], [[manufacturing]] goods, [[deforestation]] and [[desertification]]. Deliberate habitat alteration is often done with the goals of increasing material [[wealth]], increasing [[thermal comfort]], improving the amount of food available, improving [[aesthetics]], or improving ease of access to resources or other human settlements. With the advent of large-scale trade and transport infrastructure, proximity to these resources has become unnecessary, and in many places, these factors are no longer a driving force behind the growth and decline of a population. Nonetheless, the manner in which a habitat is altered is often a major determinant in population change.

Technology has allowed humans to colonize all of the continents and adapt to virtually all climates. Within the last century, humans have explored Antarctica, the ocean depths, and outer space, although large-scale colonization of these environments is not yet feasible. With a population of over six billion, humans are among the most numerous of the large mammals. Most humans (61%) live in Asia. The remainder live in the Americas (14%), Africa (14%), Europe (11%), and Oceania (0.5%).

Human habitation within [[closed ecological system]]s in hostile environments, such as Antarctica and outer space, is [[expensive]], typically limited in duration, and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions. Life in space has been very sporadic, with no more than thirteen humans in space at any given time{{Reference necessary|date=July 2011}}. Between 1969 and 1972, two humans at a time spent brief intervals on the [[exploration of the Moon|Moon]]. As of {{Monthyear}}, no other celestial body has been visited by humans, although there has been a continuous human presence in space since the launch of the initial crew to inhabit the [[International Space Station]] on October 31, 2000. However, other celestial bodies have been visited by human-made objects.

Since 1800, the [[human population]] has increased from one billion to over six billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/411162.stm | accessdate = February 5, 2008 | work=BBC News | title=World's population reaches six billion | date=August 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, some 2.5 billion out of 6.3 billion people (39.7%) lived in [[urban area]]s, and this percentage is expected to continue to rise throughout the 21st century.

[[File:Human anatomy.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Basic anatomical features of female and male humans. These models have had [[body hair]] and male [[facial hair]] removed and head hair trimmed.]]
Human body types vary substantially. Although body size is largely determined by [[gene]]s, it is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[exercise]]. The average [[human height|height]] of an adult human is about 1.5 to 1.8 m (5 to 6&amp;nbsp;feet) tall, although this varies significantly from place to place and depending on ethnic origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Beer H | title = Observations on the history of Dutch physical stature from the late-Middle Ages to the present | journal = Econ Hum Biol | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–55 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15463992 | doi = 10.1016/j.ehb.2003.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average [[human weight|mass]] of an adult human is 54–64&amp;nbsp;kg (120–140&amp;nbsp;lbs) for females and 76–83&amp;nbsp;kg (168–183&amp;nbsp;lbs) for males.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Human_weight Human weight – ArticleWorld&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Weight can also vary greatly (e.g. [[obesity]]). Unlike most other primates, humans are capable of fully bipedal [[terrestrial locomotion in animals|locomotion]], thus leaving their arms available for manipulating objects using their [[hand]]s, aided especially by opposable thumbs.
[[File:Uomo Vitruviano.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Vitruvian Man]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s image is often used as an implied symbol of the essential symmetry of the human body, and by extension, of the universe as a whole.]]

Although humans appear hairless compared to other primates, with notable [[hair]] growth occurring chiefly on the top of the head, underarms and pubic area, the average human has more [[hair follicles]] on his or her body than the average chimpanzee. The main distinction is that human hairs are shorter, finer, and less heavily pigmented than the average chimpanzee's, thus making them harder to see.&lt;ref&gt;''Why Humans and Their Fur Parted Way'' by Nicholas Wade, ''New York Times'', August 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hue of human skin and hair is determined by the presence of [[pigment]]s called [[melanin]]s. Human skin hues can range from very dark brown to very pale pink. Human hair ranges from [[white]] to [[brown hair|brown]] to [[red hair|red]] to most commonly [[black hair|black]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rogers, Alan R., Iltis, David &amp; Wooding, Stephen | year=2004 | title=Genetic variation at the MC1R locus and the time since loss of human body hair | journal=Current Anthropology | volume=45 | issue=1 | pages=105–108 | doi=10.1086/381006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This depends on the amount of melanin (an effective sun blocking pigment) in the skin and hair, with hair melanin concentrations in hair fading with increased age, leading to [[grey hair|grey]] or even white hair. Most researchers believe that skin darkening was an adaptation that evolved as a protection against [[ultraviolet]] [[solar radiation]]. However, more recently it has been argued that particular skin colors are an adaptation to balance [[folate]], which is destroyed by ultraviolet radiation, and vitamin D, which requires sunlight to form.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonski, N.G. &amp; Chaplin, G. (2000). ''[http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/chem/faculty/leontis/chem447/PDF_files/Jablonski_skin_color_2000.pdf The evolution of human skin coloration]'' (pdf), 'Journal of Human Evolution 39: 57–106.&lt;/ref&gt; The skin pigmentation of contemporary humans is geographically stratified, and in general correlates with the level of ultraviolet radiation. Human skin also has a capacity to darken ([[sun tanning]]) in response to exposure to ultraviolet radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harding RM, Healy E, Ray AJ, ''et al.'' |title=Evidence for variable selective pressures at MC1R |journal=Am.

The construction of the human [[pelvis]] differs from other primates, as do the toes. As a result, humans are slower for short distances than most other animals, but are among the best long-distance runners in the animal kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/health/27well.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Human Body Is Built for Distance | first=Tara | last=Parker-Pope | date=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans' thinner body hair and more productive sweat glands also helps avoid heat exhaustion while running for long distances. For this reason [[persistence hunting]] was most likely a very successful strategy for early humans – in this method, prey is chased until it is literally exhausted. This may have also helped the early human [[Cro-Magnon]] population out-compete the [[Neanderthal]] population for food. The otherwise physically stronger Neanderthal would have much greater difficulty hunting in this way, and much more likely hunted larger game in close quarters. A trade-off for these advantages of the modern human pelvis is that childbirth is more difficult and dangerous.

The construction of modern human shoulders enable throwing weapons, which also were much more difficult or even impossible for Neanderthal competitors to use effectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16091-were-neanderthals-stoned-to-death-by-modern-humans.html Were Neanderthals stoned to death by modern humans? - life - 20 November 2008 - New Scientist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dentition|dental formula]] of Humans is the following: {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.2.3|lower=2.1.2.3}}. Humans have proportionately shorter palates and much smaller teeth than other primates. They are the only primates to have short, relatively flush [[canine teeth]]. Humans have characteristically crowded teeth, with gaps from lost teeth usually closing up quickly in young specimens. Humans are gradually losing their [[wisdom teeth]], with some individuals having them congenitally absent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revolution&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Desmond |url = | title = The Human Revolution: From Ape to Artist | year = 1976 | page = 208 | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiology===
{{Main|Human physiology}}

Human physiology is the science of the mechanical, physical, and biochemical functions of humans in good health, their organs, and the cells of which they are composed. The principal level of focus of physiology is at the level of organs and systems. Most aspects of human physiology are closely homologous to corresponding aspects of animal physiology, and animal experimentation has provided much of the foundation of physiological knowledge. Anatomy and physiology are closely related fields of study: anatomy, the study of form, and physiology, the study of function, are intrinsically tied and are studied in tandem as part of a medical curriculum.

===Genetics===
{{Main|Human genetics}}
Humans are a [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] species. Each [[ploidy|diploid]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] has two sets of 23 [[chromosome]]s, each set received from one parent. There are 22 pairs of [[autosome]]s and one pair of [[sex-determination system|sex chromosomes]]. By present estimates, humans have approximately 20,000–25,000 genes. Like other mammals, humans have an [[XY sex-determination system]], so that [[female]]s have the sex chromosomes XX and [[male]]s have XY. The X chromosome carries many genes not on the Y chromosome, which means that [[recessive gene|recessive]] diseases associated with X-linked genes, such as [[haemophilia]], affect men more often than women.

===Life cycle===
[[Image:Tubal Pregnancy with embryo.jpg|thumb|right|125px|A 10&amp;nbsp;mm [[human embryo]] at 5 weeks]]
The human [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] is similar to that of other [[placenta]]l mammals. The [[zygote]] divides inside the female's [[uterus]] to become an embryo, which over a period of thirty-eight weeks (9 months) of [[gestation]] becomes a fetus. After this span of time, the fully grown fetus is birthed from the woman's body and breathes independently as an infant for the first time. At this point, most modern cultures recognize the baby as a person entitled to the full protection of the law, though some jurisdictions extend various levels of personhood earlier to human fetuses while they remain in the uterus.

Compared with other species, human [[childbirth]] is dangerous. Painful labors lasting twenty-four hours or more are not uncommon and sometimes leads to the death of the mother, or the child.&lt;ref&gt;According to the July 2, 2007 ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine, a woman dies in childbirth every minute, most often due to uncontrolled bleeding and infection, with the world's poorest women most vulnerable. The lifetime risk is 1 in 16 in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], compared to 1 in 2,800 in developed countries.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because of both the relatively large fetal head circumference (for housing the brain) and the mother's relatively narrow [[pelvis]] (a trait required for successful bipedalism, by way of natural selection).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = LaVelle M | title = Natural selection and developmental sexual variation in the human pelvis | journal = Am J Phys Anthropol | volume = 98 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–72 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8579191 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330980106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Correia H, Balseiro S, De Areia M | title = Sexual dimorphism in the human pelvis: testing a new hypothesis | journal = Homo | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 153–60 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16130838 | doi = 10.1016/j.jchb.2005.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chances of a successful labor increased significantly during the 20th century in wealthier countries with the advent of new medical technologies. In contrast, pregnancy and [[natural childbirth]] remain hazardous ordeals in developing regions of the world, with maternal death rates approximately 100 times more common than in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rush D | title = Nutrition and maternal mortality in the developing world | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 72 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = 212 S–240 S | year = 2000 | pmid = 10871588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developed countries, infants are typically 3–4&amp;nbsp;kg (6–9&amp;nbsp;pounds) in weight and 50–60&amp;nbsp;cm (20–24&amp;nbsp;inches) in height at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://childinfo.org/areas/birthweight/|title=Low Birthweight|accessdate=2007-05-30| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070513150431/http://www.childinfo.org/areas/birthweight/| archivedate = May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, low [[birth weight]] is common in developing countries, and contributes to the high levels of [[infant mortality]] in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Khor G | title = Update on the prevalence of malnutrition among children in Asia | journal = Nepal Med Coll J | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–22 | year = 2003 | pmid = 15024783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helpless at birth, humans continue to grow for some years, typically reaching [[sexual maturity]] at 12 to 15&amp;nbsp;years of age. Females continue to develop physically until around the age of 18, whereas male development continues until around age 21. The human life span can be split into a number of stages: infancy, [[childhood]], [[adolescence]], [[young adulthood]], [[adult]]hood and [[old age]]. The lengths of these stages, however, have varied across cultures and time periods. Compared to other primates, humans experience an unusually rapid growth spurt during adolescence, where the body grows 25% in size. Chimpanzees, for example, grow only 14%, with no pronounced spurt.&lt;ref&gt;Leakey, Richard; Lewin, Roger. Origins Reconsidered – In Search of What Makes Us Human. Sherma B.V., 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the growth spurt is probably necessary to keep children physically small until they are psychologically mature. Humans are one of the few species in which females undergo [[menopause]]. It has been proposed that menopause increases a woman's overall reproductive success by allowing her to invest more time and resources in her existing offspring and/or their children (the [[grandmother hypothesis]]), rather than by continuing to bear children into old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diamond | first = Jared | authorlink = Jared_M._Diamond | title = Why is Sex Fun?

There are significant differences in life expectancy around the world. The developed world is generally aging, with the median age around 40&amp;nbsp;years.

[[File:RaceMugshots.jpg|A collection of [[head shot]]s showing multiple races|thumb|250px]]

Humans often categorize themselves in terms of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[ethnic group|ethnicity]], sometimes on the basis of differences in appearance. Human racial categories have been based on both [[ancestry]] and visible [[trait (biological)|traits]], especially facial features, skull shape, [[human skin color|skin color]] and hair texture. Most current [[Genetic anthropology|genetic]] and archaeological evidence supports a [[recent single origin hypothesis|recent single origin]] of modern humans in [[East Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hua Liu, et al. | title = A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History | url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/issues/v79n2/43550/43550.html | journal = The American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 230–237 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16826514 | pmc = 1559480 | doi = 10.1086/505436 | format =  – &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AA+Geographically+Explicit+Genetic+Model+of+Worldwide+Human-Settlement+History&amp;as_publication=The+American+Journal+of+Human+Genetics&amp;as_ylo=2006&amp;as_yhi=2006&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{Dead link|date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current genetic studies have demonstrated that humans on the African continent are most genetically diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jorde L, Watkins W, Bamshad M, Dixon M, Ricker C, Seielstad M, Batzer M | title = The distribution of human genetic diversity: a comparison of mitochondrial, autosomal, and Y-chromosome data | url= | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 979–88 | year = 2000 | pmc=1288178 | pmid = 10712212 | doi = 10.1086/302825}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, compared to the other [[great ape]]s, [[Population bottleneck#Humans|human gene sequences]] are [[Human genetic variation#History and geographic distribution|remarkably homogeneous]].&lt;ref name=&quot;REGWG&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=The use of racial, ethnic, and ancestral categories in human genetics research |journal=Am.

Ethnic groups are defined by linguistic, cultural, ancestral, national or regional ties. Self-identification with an ethnic group is usually based on [[kinship and descent]]. Race and ethnicity are among major factors in [[social identity]] giving rise to various forms of [[identity politics]], e.g., [[racism]].

There is no scientific consensus of a list of the human races, and few anthropologists endorse the notion of human &quot;race&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Human Races: A Genetic and Evolutionary Perspective&quot;, Alan R. Templeton, American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 100, No. 3 (Sep., 1998), pp. 632–650&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[color terminology for race]] includes the following in a classification of human races: Black (e.g. Sub-Saharan Africa), Red (e.g. Native Americans), Yellow (e.g. East Asians) and White (e.g. Europeans).

Referring to natural species, in general, the term &quot;race&quot; is obsolete, particularly if a species is uniformly distributed on a territory. In its modern scientific connotation, the term is not applicable to a species as genetically homogeneous as the human one, as stated in the declaration on race (UNESCO 1950).&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001282/128291eo.pdf Unseco Publication 791]&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic studies have substantiated the absence of clear biological borders, thus the term &quot;race&quot; is rarely used in scientific terminology, both in biological anthropology and in human genetics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} What in the past had been defined as &quot;races&quot;—e.g., whites, blacks, or Asians—are now defined as &quot;ethnic groups&quot; or &quot;populations&quot;, in correlation with the field (sociology, anthropology, genetics) in which they are considered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Humans are [[omnivorous]], capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haenel H |title=Phylogenesis and nutrition |journal=Nahrung |volume=33 |issue=9 |pages=867–87 |year=1989 |pmid=2697806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Peter S.

Until the development of agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago, ''Homo sapiens'' employed a hunter-gatherer method as their sole means of food collection.

===Sleep===
{{Main|Sleep}}
Humans are generally [[Diurnality|diurnal]]. The average [[sleep]] requirement is between seven and nine hours per day for an adult and nine to ten hours per day for a child; elderly people usually sleep for six to seven hours. Experiencing less sleep than this is common in modern societies; this [[sleep deprivation]] can have negative effects. A sustained restriction of adult sleep to four hours per day has been shown to correlate with changes in physiology and mental state, including fatigue, aggression, and bodily discomfort.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Psychology==
[[Image:Davidbrain.JPG|thumb|right|A sketch of the human brain imposed upon the profile of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'']]
{{Main|Psychology}}
{{See|Human brain|Mind}}

The [[human brain]], the focal point of the [[central nervous system]] in humans, controls the [[peripheral nervous system]]. In addition to controlling &quot;lower&quot;, involuntary, or primarily [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] activities such as [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[digestion]], it is also the locus of &quot;higher&quot; order functioning such as [[thought]], [[reason]]ing, and [[abstraction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/brain/3d/index.html 3-D Brain Anatomy], ''The Secret Life of the Brain'', Public Broadcasting Service. Retrieved April 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; These [[mental function|cognitive processes]] constitute the [[mind]], and, along with their [[behavior]]al consequences, are studied in the field of [[psychology]].

Generally regarded as more capable of these higher order activities, the human brain is believed to be more &quot;intelligent&quot; in general than that of any other known species. While some non-human species are capable of creating structures and using simple tools—mostly through instinct and mimicry—human technology is vastly more complex, and is constantly evolving and improving through time.

Although being vastly more advanced than many species in cognitive abilities, most of these abilities are known in primitive form among other species. Modern anthropology has tended to bear out [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] proposition that &quot;the difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AnthropologyTodayApr07&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jonathan Benthall |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8322.2007.00494.x |title=Animal liberation and rights |publisher=blackwell-synergy.com |page= 23/2 |date=April 2007 :1 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8322.2007.00494.x |journal=Anthropology Today |volume=23 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consciousness and thought===
{{Main|Consciousness|Cognition}}
Humans are one of only nine species known to pass the [[mirror test]]—which tests whether an animal recognizes its reflection as an image of itself—along with all the [[great apes]] ([[gorillas]], [[chimpanzees]], [[orangutans]], [[bonobo]]s), [[Bottlenose dolphins]], [[Asian elephants]], [[European Magpie]]s, and [[Orcas]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Allan explores a few of these experiments on his webpage {{cite web |url=http://ww2.lafayette.edu/~allanr/mirror.html |title=? |publisher=Lafayette College }}{{dead link |date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most human children will pass the mirror test at 18 months old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulm.edu/~palmer/ConsciousnessandtheSymbolicUniverse.htm |title=Consciousness and the Symbolic Universe |author=Dr. Jack Palmer |accessdate=March 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the usefulness of this test as a true test of consciousness has been disputed, and this may be a matter of degree rather than a sharp divide. Monkeys have been trained to apply abstract rules in tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2001/abstract-0718.html Researchers home in on how brain handles abstract thought] – retrieved July 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The human brain perceives the external world through the [[sense]]s, and each individual human is influenced greatly by his or her experiences, leading to [[subjectivity|subjective]] views of [[existence]] and the passage of time. Humans are variously said to possess [[consciousness]], [[self-awareness]], and a mind, which correspond roughly to the mental processes of [[thought]]. These are said to possess qualities such as self-awareness, [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and the ability to perceive the relationship between [[Personal identity (philosophy)|oneself]] and one's [[natural environment|environment]]. The extent to which the mind constructs or experiences the outer world is a matter of debate, as are the definitions and validity of many of the terms used above. The philosopher of [[cognitive science]] [[Daniel Dennett]], for example, argues that there is no such thing as a narrative centre called the &quot;mind&quot;, but that instead there is simply a collection of sensory inputs and outputs: different kinds of &quot;software&quot; running in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel (1991). ''Consciousness Explained''. Little Brown &amp; Co, 1991, ISBN 0-316-18065-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]] argued that the mind is an explanatory fiction that diverts attention from environmental causes of behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. About Behaviorism 1974, page 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; and that what are commonly seen as mental processes may be better conceived of as forms of covert verbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. ''About Behaviorism'', Chapter 7: Thinking&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A thesis against which [[Noam Chomsky#Contributions to psychology|Noam Chomsky]] advanced a considerable polemic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans study the more physical aspects of the mind and brain, and by extension of the nervous system, in the field of [[neurology]], the more behavioral in the field of psychology, and a sometimes loosely defined area between in the field of psychiatry, which treats mental illness and behavioral disorders. Psychology does not necessarily refer to the brain or nervous system, and can be framed purely in terms of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] or [[information processing]] theories of the mind. Increasingly, however, an understanding of brain functions is being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[cognitive neuroscience]].

The nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. [[Cognitive psychology]] studies [[cognition]], the [[mental function|mental processes']] underlying behavior. It uses [[information processing]] as a framework for understanding the mind. Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are all well researched areas as well. Cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], whose adherents argue for an [[information processing]] model of mental function, informed by [[positivism]] and [[experimental psychology]]. Techniques and models from cognitive psychology are widely applied and form the mainstay of psychological theories in many areas of both research and applied psychology. Largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, [[developmental psychology]] seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or [[moral development]].

Some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is experience itself, and access consciousness, which is the processing of the things in experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bl&quot;&gt;Ned Block: ''On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness'' in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenal consciousness is the state of being conscious, such as when they say &quot;I am conscious.&quot; Access consciousness is being conscious ''of'' something in relation to abstract concepts, such as when one says &quot;I am conscious of these words.&quot; Various forms of access consciousness include awareness, self-awareness, conscience, [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Husserl's phenomenology]], and [[intentionality]]. The concept of phenomenal consciousness, in modern history, according to some, is closely related to the concept of [[qualia]]. [[Social psychology]] links sociology with psychology in their shared study of the nature and causes of human social interaction, with an emphasis on how people think towards each other and how they relate to each other. The behavior and mental processes, both human and non-human, can be described through [[animal cognition]], [[ethology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[comparative psychology]] as well. [[Human ecology]] is an [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] that investigates how humans and human [[society|societies]] interact with both their natural environment and the human [[social environment]].

===Motivation and emotion===
{{Main|Motivation|Emotion}}

[[Motivation]] is the driving force of desire behind all deliberate [[Action (philosophy)|actions]] of humans. Motivation is based on emotion—specifically, on the search for [[Contentment|satisfaction]] (positive emotional experiences), and the avoidance of conflict. Positive and negative is defined by the individual brain state, which may be influenced by [[social norm]]s: a person may be driven to [[self-injury]] or [[violence]] because his [[Human brain|brain]] is conditioned to create a positive response to these actions. Motivation is important because it is involved in the performance of all learned responses. Within [[psychology]], [[conflict avoidance]] and the [[libido]] are seen to be primary motivators. Within [[economics]], motivation is often seen to be based on [[incentive]]s; these may be [[financial]], [[moral]], or [[coercive]]. [[Religion]]s generally posit divine or [[demon]]ic influences.

[[Happiness]], or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common [[philosophy|philosophical]] topic. Some people might define it as the best condition that a human can have—a condition of [[mental health|mental]] and physical [[health]]. Others define it as [[wikt:freedom|freedom]] from want and distress; consciousness of the [[goodness and value theory|good]] order of things; assurance of one's place in the [[universe]] or [[society]].

Emotion has a significant influence on, or can even be said to control, human behavior, though historically many [[culture]]s and [[philosopher]]s have for various reasons discouraged allowing this influence to go unchecked. Emotional experiences perceived as pleasant, such as [[love]], admiration, or joy, contrast with those perceived as unpleasant, like [[hate]], [[envy]], or [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. There is often a distinction made between refined emotions that are socially learned and [[wiktionary:survival|survival]] oriented emotions, which are thought to be innate. Human exploration of emotions as separate from other neurological phenomena is worthy of note, particularly in cultures where emotion is considered separate from physiological state. In some cultural medical theories emotion is considered so synonymous with certain forms of physical health that no difference is thought to exist. The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed excessive emotion was harmful, while some [[Sufi]] teachers felt certain extreme emotions could yield a conceptual perfection, what is often translated as [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]].

In modern scientific thought, certain refined emotions are considered a complex neural trait innate in a variety of [[domesticated animal|domesticated]] and non-domesticated [[mammal]]s. These were commonly developed in reaction to superior survival mechanisms and intelligent interaction with each other and the environment; as such, refined emotion is not in all cases as discrete and separate from natural neural function as was once assumed. However, when humans function in civilized tandem, it has been noted that uninhibited acting on extreme emotion can lead to social disorder and [[crime]].

But beyond any other creature, humans are adept at utilizing systems of [[communication]] for self-expression, the exchange of ideas, and [[social organization|organization]], and as such have created complex [[social structures]] composed of many cooperating and competing groups. Human groups range from families to [[nations]]. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values, social norms, and rituals, which together form the basis of human [[society]].

[[Culture]] is defined here as patterns of complex symbolic behavior, i.e. all behavior that is not innate but which has to be learned through social interaction with others; such as the use of distinctive [[material culture|material]] and [[symbolic system]]s, including language, ritual, social organization, traditions, beliefs and technology.

===Sexuality and love===
{{Main|Love|Human sexuality}}

[[Human sexuality]], besides ensuring biological [[reproduction]], has important social functions: it creates physical intimacy, bonds, and hierarchies among individuals; and in a [[hedonism|hedonistic]] sense to the enjoyment of activity involving sexual gratification. Sexual desire, or [[libido]], is experienced as a bodily urge, often accompanied by strong emotions such as love, [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] and jealousy. The extreme importance of sexuality in the human species can be seen in a number of physical features, among them hidden ovulation, the evolution of external scrotum and penis suggesting sperm competition, the absence of an [[Baculum|os penis]], permanent [[secondary sexual characteristics]], the forming of pair bonds based on sexual attraction as a common social structure and sexual ability in females outside of ovulation. These adaptations indicate that the importance of sexuality in humans is on a par with that found in the [[Bonobo]], and that the complex human sexual behaviour has a long [[evolution]]ary history.

Human choices in acting on sexuality are commonly influenced by cultural norms, which vary widely. Restrictions are often determined by religious beliefs or social customs. The pioneering researcher [[Sigmund Freud]] believed that humans are born [[Psychosexual development|polymorphously perverse]], which means that any number of objects could be a source of pleasure. According to Freud, humans then pass through five stages of [[psychosexual development]] (and can fixate on any stage because of various traumas during the process). For [[Alfred Kinsey]], another influential sex researcher, people can fall anywhere along a continuous scale of sexual orientation (with only small minorities fully [[heterosexual]] or [[homosexual]]). Recent studies of neurology and genetics suggest people may be born predisposed to various sexual tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, David M. (2004) &quot;The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating&quot;. Revised Edition. New York: Basic Books&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2000). A Natural History of Rape. Biological Bases of Sexual Coercion. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender roles===
{{Main|Gender role}}
{{See also|Gender}}
The sexual division of humans into male and female has been marked culturally by a corresponding division of roles, norms, practices, dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and power. Cultural differences by gender have often been believed to have arisen naturally out of a division of reproductive labor; the biological fact that women give birth led to their further cultural responsibility for nurturing and caring for children and households. [[Gender role]]s have varied historically, and challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies. As a whole, [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] societies (i.e., in which men hold the greater degree of economic and political power) have been predominant, and [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] or [[egalitarian]] societies less common.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Connell, ''Gender and power: society, the person, and sexual politics'' Stanford University Press, 1987, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Goldberg, ''[[The Inevitability of Patriarchy]]'', (William Morrow &amp; Company, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joan Bamberger,'The Myth of Matriarchy: Why Men Rule in Primitive Society', in M Rosaldo and L Lamphere, ''Women, Culture, and Society'', Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1974, pp. 263-280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/goettnerabendroth.html Modern Matriarchal Studies Definitions, Scope and Topicality - Heide Goettner-Abendroth]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society, government, and politics===
[[Image:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|thumb|right|The [[United Nations]] complex in [[New York City]], which houses one of the largest political organizations in the world.]]

{{Main|Society|Government|Politics|State (polity)}}
[[Society]] is the system of organizations and institutions arising from interaction between humans. A [[State (polity)|state]] is an organized [[politics|political]] community occupying a definite territory, having an organized [[government]], and possessing internal and external [[sovereignty]]. Recognition of the state's claim to independence by other states, enabling it to enter into international agreements, is often important to the establishment of its statehood. The &quot;state&quot; can also be defined in terms of domestic conditions, specifically, as conceptualized by [[Max Weber]], &quot;a state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the 'legitimate' use of physical force within a given territory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdx.ac.uk/www/study/xweb.htm Max Weber's definition of the modern state 1918], by [[Max Weber]], 1918. Retrieved March 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Government]] can be defined as the [[politics|political]] means of creating and enforcing [[law]]s; typically via a [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[hierarchy]]. [[Politics]] is the process by which decisions are made within groups; this process often involves conflict as well as compromise. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within [[government]]s, politics is also observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. Many different political systems exist, as do many different ways of understanding them, and many definitions overlap. Examples of governments include [[monarchy]], [[Communist state]], [[military dictatorship]], [[theocracy]], and [[liberal democracy]], the last of which is considered dominant today. All of these issues have a direct relationship with economics.

===Trade and economics===
{{Main|Trade|Economics}}
[[File:Tengeru market.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Buyer]]s and [[seller]]s [[bargaining|bargain]] in a market.]]
Trade is the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and is a form of [[economics]]. A mechanism that allows trade is called a [[market]]. The original form of trade was [[barter (economics)|barter]], the direct exchange of goods and services. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or [[earnings|earning]]. The invention of money (and later [[Credit (finance)|credit]], paper money and non-physical money) greatly simplified and promoted trade. Because of specialization and [[division of labor]], most people concentrate on a small aspect of manufacturing or service, trading their labour for products. Trade exists between regions because different regions have an [[Absolute advantage|absolute]] or [[comparative advantage]] in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of [[mass production]].

Economics is a [[social science]] which studies the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: [[microeconomics]], which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers the economy as a whole, in which case it considers [[aggregate supply]] and [[aggregate demand|demand]] for money, [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[commodity|commodities]]. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are [[resource allocation]], production, distribution, trade, and [[competition]]. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic [[Value (economics)|value]].
===War===
{{Main|War}}
[[Image:Nagasakibomb.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] immediately killed over 120,000 humans.]]
War is a state of widespread conflict between states or other large groups of humans, which is characterized by the use of lethal [[violence]] between combatants and/or upon [[civilians]]. (Humans also engage in lesser conflicts, such as brawls, [[riots]], [[revolts]], and [[melees]]. A [[revolution]] may or may not involve warfare.) It is estimated that during the 20th century between 167 and 188 million humans died as a result of war.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Niall. &quot;The Next War of the World.&quot; Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A common perception of war is a series of [[military campaign]]s between at least two opposing sides involving a dispute over [[sovereignty]], territory, [[natural resource|resources]], [[religion]], or other issues. A war between internal elements of a state is a [[civil war]].

There have been a wide variety of [[Revolution in Military Affairs|rapidly advancing]] [[military tactics|tactics]] throughout the history of war, ranging from [[conventional war]] to [[asymmetric warfare]] to [[total war]] and [[unconventional warfare]]. Techniques include [[hand to hand combat]], the use of [[ranged weapons]], [[Naval warfare]], and, more recently, [[air support]]. Military intelligence has often played a key role in determining victory and defeat. Propaganda, which often includes information, slanted opinion and disinformation, plays a key role in maintaining unity within a warring group, and/or sowing discord among opponents. In modern warfare, [[soldiers]] and [[combat vehicle]]s are used to control the land, [[warships]] the sea, and [[aircraft]] the sky. These fields have also overlapped in the forms of marines, paratroopers, naval aircraft carriers, and surface-to-air missiles, among others. [[Satellites]] in [[low Earth orbit]] have made outer space a factor in warfare as well as it is used for detailed intelligence gathering, however no known aggressive actions have been taken from [[space warfare|space]].

===Material culture and technology===
{{Main|Tool|Technology}}
[[Image:Bifaz abbevillense.png|thumb|right| An archaic [[Acheulean]] stone tool]]
Stone tools were used by proto-humans at least 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clark JD, de Heinzelin J, Schick KD, ''et al.'' |title=African Homo erectus: old radiometric ages and young Oldowan assemblages in the Middle Awash Valley, Ethiopia |journal=Science (journal) |volume=264 |issue=5167 |pages=1907–10 |year=1994 |month=June |pmid=8009220 |doi=10.1126/science.8009220 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Control of fire by early humans|controlled use of fire]] began around 1.5 million years ago. Since then, humans have made major advances, developing complex technology to create tools to aid their lives and allowing for other advancements in culture. Major leaps in technology include the discovery of [[agriculture]] – what is known as the [[Neolithic Revolution]]; and the invention of automated machines in the [[Industrial Revolution]].

[[Archaeology]] attempts to tell the story of past or lost cultures in part by close examination of the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] they produced. Early humans left [[stone tools]], [[pottery]], and [[jewelry]] that are particular to various regions and times.

===Language===
{{Main|Language}}
The capacity humans have to transfer concepts, ideas and notions through speech and writing is unrivaled in known species. Unlike the call systems of other primates that are closed, human language is far more open, and gains variety in different situations. The human language has the quality of displacement, using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring, but elsewhere or at a different time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revolution&quot;/&gt; In this way data networks are important to the continuing development of language. The faculty of speech is a defining feature of humanity, possibly predating [[phylogenetic]] separation of the modern population. Language is central to the communication between humans, as well as being central to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups. The invention of writing systems at least 5,000 years ago allowed the preservation of language on material objects, and was a major step in cultural evolution. The science of [[linguistics]] describes the structure of language and the relationship between languages. There are approximately 6,000 different languages currently in use, including sign languages, and many thousands more that are considered [[extinct language|extinct]].

===Spirituality and religion===
{{Main|Spirituality|Religion}}
[[Religion]] is generally defined as a [[belief]] system concerning the supernatural, sacred or divine, and practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief.  Some religions also have a [[moral code]].  The [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|evolution]] and the history of the [[Evolutionary origin of religions|first religions]] have recently become areas of active scientific investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/|title=Evolutionary Religious Studies: A New Field of Scientific Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boyer P |title=Being human: Religion: bound to believe? |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1038–9 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18948934 |doi=10.1038/4551038a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = R.F | year = 2003 | title = The psychology of religion | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | pmid = 12171998 | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 377–402 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145024 | first1 = Robert A. | last2 = Paloutzian | first2 = Raymond F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the course of its [[development of religion|development]], religion has taken on many forms that vary by culture and individual perspective. Some of the chief questions and issues religions are concerned with include life after death (commonly involving belief in an [[afterlife]]), the [[origin of life]], the nature of the [[universe]] ([[religious cosmology]]) and its [[ultimate fate of the universe|ultimate fate]] ([[eschatology]]), and what is [[morality|moral]] or immoral. A common source in religions for answers to these questions are beliefs in [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[divinity|divine]] beings such as [[deity|deities]] or a singular [[God]], although not all religions are [[theism|theistic]]—many are [[nontheism|nontheistic]] or ambiguous on the topic, particularly among the [[Eastern religion]]s. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the [[soul]] or [[spirit]], is one of the many different approaches humans take in trying to answer fundamental questions about humankind's place in the universe, the [[meaning of life]], and the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science, spirituality is unique in that it focuses on [[mystical]] or supernatural concepts such as [[karma]] and God.

Although the exact level of religiosity can be hard to measure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hall DE, Meador KG, Koenig HG |title=Measuring religiousness in health research: review and critique |journal=J Relig Health |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=134–63 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=19105008 |doi=10.1007/s10943-008-9165-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a majority of humans professes some variety of religious or spiritual belief, although some are [[irreligion|irreligious]]: that is lacking or rejecting belief in the supernatural or spiritual. Other humans have no religious beliefs and are [[atheism|atheists]], [[scientific skeptics]], [[agnostics]] or simply [[non-religious]]. [[Humanism]] is a philosophy which seeks to include all of humanity and all issues common to humans; it is usually non-religious. Additionally, although most religions and spiritual beliefs are clearly distinct from science on both a philosophical and methodological level, the two are not generally considered mutually exclusive; a majority of humans holds a mix of both scientific and religious views. The distinction between philosophy and religion, on the other hand, is at times less clear, and the two are linked in such fields as the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[theology]].

===Philosophy and self-reflection===
{{Main|Philosophy|Human self-reflection}}
{{See also|Human nature}}
[[Image:Confuciusstatue.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Statue of [[Confucius]] on [[Chongming Island]] in [[Shanghai]]]]

[[Philosophy]] is a discipline or field of study involving the investigation, analysis, and development of ideas at a general, abstract, or fundamental level. It is the discipline searching for a general understanding of reality, reasoning and values. Major fields of philosophy include [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[axiology]] (which includes [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]). Philosophy covers a very wide range of approaches, and is used to refer to a [[worldview]], to a perspective on an issue, or to the positions argued for by a particular philosopher or school of philosophy.

===Art, music, and literature===
{{Main|Art|Music|Literature}}
[[Image:Lorenzo Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Allegory of Music'' (ca. 1594), a [[painting]] of a woman writing [[sheet music]] by [[Lorenzo Lippi]]]]
Artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind, from early [[Prehistory|pre-historic]] art to contemporary art. Art is one of the most unusual aspects of human behaviour and a key distinguishing feature of humans from other species.

As a form of [[culture|cultural]] expression by humans, art may be defined by the pursuit of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and the usage of [[narrative]]s of liberation and exploration (i.e. [[art history]], [[art criticism]], and [[art theory]]) to mediate its boundaries. This distinction may be applied to objects or performances, current or historical, and its prestige extends to those who made, found, exhibit, or own them. In the modern use of the word, art is commonly understood to be the process or result of making material works that, from concept to creation, adhere to the &quot;creative impulse&quot; of human beings. Art is distinguished from other works by being in large part unprompted by necessity, by biological drive, or by any undisciplined pursuit of recreation.

Music is a natural [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] phenomenon based on the three distinct and interrelated organization structures of rhythm, harmony, and melody. Listening to music is perhaps the most common and universal form of [[entertainment]] for humans, while learning and understanding it are popular [[discipline]]s. There are a wide variety of [[music genre]]s and [[ethnic music]]s. [[Literature]], the body of written—and possibly oral—works, especially creative ones, includes prose, poetry and drama, both fiction and [[non-fiction]]. Literature includes such genres as [[epic poetry|epic]], legend, myth, ballad, and folklore.
