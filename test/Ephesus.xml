'''Ephesus''' ([[Ancient Greek]] '''{{polytonic|Ἔφεσος}}''', ''Ephesos''; [[Turkish language|Turkish]] '''Efes''') was an ancient Greek city, and later a major Roman city, on the west coast of [[Asia Minor]], near present-day [[Selçuk]], [[Izmir Province]], [[Turkey]]. It was one of the twelve cities of the [[Ionian League]] during the [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] era. In the Roman period, it was for many years the second largest city of the [[Roman Empire]]; ranking behind [[Rome]], the empire's capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quezi.com/7401 Quezi: Ephesus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OCU&gt;[http://www.oc.edu/president/greece_turkey_tour/Ephesus.aspx Oklahoma Christian University: Ephesus]&lt;/ref&gt; Ephesus had a population of more than 250,000 in the 1st century BC, which also made it the second largest city in the world.&lt;ref name=OCU/&gt;

The city was famed for the [[Temple of Artemis]] (completed around 550 BC), one of the [[Wonders of the World|Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. The temple was destroyed in 401 AD by a mob led by St. [[John Chrysostom]].&lt;ref&gt;John Freely, ''The Western Shores of Turkey: Discovering the Aegean and Mediterranean Coasts'', 2004, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;  Emperor [[Constantine I]] rebuilt much of the city and erected new public baths. The town was again partially destroyed by an earthquake in 614 AD. The city's importance as a commercial center declined as the harbor was slowly silted up by the [[Cayster River]] (''Küçük Menderes''). 

Ephesus was one of the [[seven churches of Asia]] that are cited in the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;2:1–7&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of John]] may have been written here.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], ''Understanding the Bible'', Palo Alto, Mayfield, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The city was the site of several 5th century Christian Councils, see [[Council of Ephesus]].   It is also the site of a large [[gladiator]]s' graveyard. 

Today's archaeological site lies 3 kilometers southwest of the town of [[Selçuk]], in the Selçuk district of [[İzmir Province]], [[Turkey]]. The [[ruins]] of Ephesus are a favorite international and local tourist attraction, partly owing to their easy access from [[Adnan Menderes Airport]] and via the port of [[Kuşadası]].

== History ==
=== Neolithic age ===

The area surrounding Ephesus was already inhabited during the Neolithic Age (about 6000 BC), as was revealed by the excavations at the nearby ''hoyuk'' (artificial mounds known as [[tell]]s) of Arvalya and Cukurici.&lt;ref&gt;[VIII. Muze Kurtrma Kazilari Semineri ] ''Adil Evren - Cengiz Icten,pp 111-133'' [[1997]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Arkeoloji ve Sanat Dergisi - Cukurici Hoyuk sayi 92 ] ''Adil Evren'' [[1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bronze age ===

Excavations in recent years have unearthed settlements from the early [[Bronze Age]] at the Ayasuluk Hill. In 1954 a burial ground from the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] era (1500-1400 BC) with ceramic pots was discovered close to the ruins of the basilica of St. John.&lt;ref name=&quot;C. Özgünel&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Coskun Özgünel| title=Mykenische Keramik in Anatolien| journal=Asia Minor Studien| year=1996| volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the period of the Mycenaean Expansion when the [[Achaeans|''Achaioi''/''Ἀχαιοί'']] (as they were called by [[Homer]]) settled in [[Ahhiyawa]] during the 14th and 13th centuries BC. Scholars believe that Ephesus was founded on the settlement of Apasa (or ''Abasa''), a Bronze Age-city noted in 14th-century BC [[Hittite language|Hittite]] sources as the land of Ahhiyawa. &lt;!--- Ahhiyawa was one of several (semi-)independent states surrounding the Hittite state ---&gt; &lt;!--- Arzawa, another independent state, was in southern Anatolia/Asia Minor ---&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Akurgal&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Ekrem Akurgal|Akurgal, Ekrem]]|title = The Hattian and Hittite Civilizations| page = 111| publisher = Publications of the Republic of Turkey; Ministry of Culture| year = 2001| isbn = 975-17-2756-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark ages===

[[File:Ac artemisephesus.jpg|thumb|Site of the [[Temple of Artemis]] in the town of [[Selçuk]], near Ephesus.]]

Ephesus was founded as an Attic-Ionian colony in the 10th century BC on the Ayasuluk Hill, three kilometers from the center of ancient Ephesus (as attested by excavations at the [[Seljuk]] castle during the 1990s). The mythical founder of the city was a prince of [[Athens]] named [[Androklos]], who had to leave his country after the death of his father, King Kadros. According to the legend, he founded Ephesus on the place where the oracle of [[Delphi]] became reality (&quot;A fish and a boar will show you the way&quot;). Androklos drove away most of the native [[Caria]]n and [[Leleges|Lelegian]] inhabitants of the city and united his people with the remainder. He was a successful warrior, and as a king he was able to join the twelve cities of [[Ionia]] together into the [[Ionian League]]. During his reign the city began to prosper. He died in a battle against the Carians when he came to the aid of [[Priene]], another city of the Ionian League.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pausanius&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Description of Greece,| last=Pausanius| year=1965| pages=7.2.8–9| publisher=Loeb Classical Library| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Androklos and his dog are depicted on the Hadrian temple frieze, dating from the 2nd century. Later, Greek historians such as [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [[Strabo]], the poet Kallinos, and the historian [[Herodotos]] reassigned the city's mythological foundation to Ephos, queen of the [[Amazons]].

The Greek goddess [[Artemis]] and the great Anatolian goddess [[Kybele]] were identified together as ''Artemis of Ephesus''. The many-breasted &quot;Lady of Ephesus&quot;, identified with Artemis, was venerated in the [[Temple of Artemis]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]] and the largest building of the ancient world according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (4.31.8). Pausanius mentions that the temple was built by Ephesus, son of the river god [[Caystrus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1133.html |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology |publisher=Ancientlibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the arrival of the Ionians. Of this structure, scarcely a trace remains.

=== Archaic period ===

About 650 BC, Ephesus was attacked by the [[Cimmerians]], who razed the city, including the temple of Artemis. 
When the Cimmerians had been driven away, the city was ruled by a series of tyrants. After a revolt by the people, Ephesus was ruled by a council called the ''Kuretes''. The city prospered again, producing a number of important historical figures, such as the [[iambic]] poet [[Callinus]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Callinus&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Greek Lyric Poetry| url=http://books.google.com/?id=cABi5Pt7FgQC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Ephesus++%22poetess%22| last=translation by M.L. West| year=1999| page=21| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=0192836781}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the satirist [[Hipponax]], the philosopher [[Heraclitus]], the great painter [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]] and later the grammarian [[Zenodotos]] and physicians [[Soranus (Greek physician)|Soranus]] and Rufus.

About 560 BC Ephesus was conquered by the [[Lydians]] under king [[Croesus]]. He treated the inhabitants with respect, despite ruling harshly, and even became the main contributor to the reconstruction of the temple of Artemis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Croesus made the populations of the different settlements around Ephesus regroup (''[[synoikismos]]'') in the vicinity of the Temple of Artemis, enlarging the city.

Later in the same century, the Lydians under Croesus invaded Persia. The Ionians refused a peace offer from [[Cyrus the Great]], siding with the Lydians instead. After the Persians defeated Croesus the Ionians offered to make peace, but Cyrus insisted that they surrender and become part of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus i. 141&lt;/ref&gt; They were defeated by the Persian army commander [[Harpagos]] in 547 BC. The Persians then incorporated the Greek cities of Asia Minor into the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Those cities were then ruled by [[satrap]]s.

Ephesus has intrigued archaeologists because for the Archaic Period there is no definite location for the settlement. There are numerous sites to suggest the movement of a settlement between the Bronze Age and the Roman period, but the silting up of the natural harbors as well as the movement of the Kayster River meant that the location never remained the same.

=== Classical period ===

Ephesus continued to prosper. But when taxes continued to be raised under [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses II]] and [[Darius the Great of Persia|Darius]], the Ephesians participated in the [[Ionian Revolt]] against Persian rule in the [[Battle of Ephesus (498 BC)]], an event which instigated the [[Greco-Persian wars]]. In 479 BC, the Ionians, together with [[Athens]] and [[History of Sparta|Sparta]], were able to oust the Persians from the shores of Asia Minor. In 478 BC, the Ionian cities entered with Athens and Sparta into the [[Delian League]] against the Persians. Ephesus did not contribute ships but gave financial support by offering the treasure of [[Apollo]] to the goddess [[Athena]], protectress of Athens.

During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Ephesus was first allied to Athens{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} but sided in a later phase, called the Decelean War, or the Ionian War, with Sparta, which also had received the support of the Persians. As a result, rule over the cities of Ionia was ceded again to Persia.

These wars did not much affect daily life in Ephesus. The Ephesians were surprisingly modern in their social relations. They allowed strangers to integrate. Education was much valued. Through the cult of Artemis, the city also became a bastion of women's rights. Ephesus even had female artists. In later times, [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned having seen at Ephesus a representation of the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] by Timarata, the daughter of a painter.

In 356 BC the temple of Artemis was burned down, according to legend, by a lunatic called Herostratus. The inhabitants of Ephesus at once set about restoring the temple and even planned a larger and grander one than the original.

=== Hellenistic period ===

[[File:Karte Ephesos MKL1888.png|thumb|Historical map of Ephesus, from ''[[Meyers Konversationslexikon]]'', 1888]]

When [[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Persian forces at the [[Battle of Granicus]] in 334 BC, the Greek cities of Asia Minor were liberated. The pro-Persian tyrant Syrpax and his family were stoned to death, and Alexander was greeted warmly when he entered Ephesus in triumph. When Alexander saw that the temple of Artemis was not yet finished, he proposed to finance it and have his name inscribed on the front. But the inhabitants of Ephesus demurred, claiming that it was not fitting for one god to build a temple to another. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, Ephesus in 290 BC came under the rule of one of Alexander's generals, [[Lysimachus]].

As the river [[Cayster]] (Grk. name Κάϋστρος) silted up the harbor, the resulting marshes caused malaria and many deaths among the inhabitants. The people of Ephesus were forced to move to a new settlement two kilometers further on, when the king flooded the old city by blocking the sewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strabo&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Geography (volume 1-7)| last=Strabo| date=1923-19-32| pages=14.1.21| publisher=Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press| location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement was called after the king's second wife, [[Arsinoe II of Egypt]]. After [[Lysimachus]] had destroyed the nearby cities of [[Lebedos]] and [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] in 292 BC, he relocated their inhabitants to the new city.

Ephesus revolted after the treacherous death of [[Agathocles (son of Lysimachus)|Agathocles]], giving the Hellenistic king of Syria and Mesopotamia [[Seleucus I Nicator]] an opportunity for removing and killing Lysimachus, his last rival, at the [[Battle of Corupedium]] in 281 BC. After the death of Lysimachus the town again was named Ephesus.

Thus Ephesus became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. After the murder of king [[Antiochus II Theos]] and his Egyptian wife, pharaoh [[Ptolemy III]] invaded the Seleucid Empire and the Egyptian fleet swept the coast of Asia Minor. Ephesus came under Egyptian rule between 263-197 BC.

When the Seleucid king [[Antiochus III the Great]] tried to regain the Greek cities of Asia Minor, he came in conflict with [[Rome]]. After a series of battles, he was defeated by [[Scipio Asiaticus]] at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] in 190 BC. As a result, Ephesus came under the rule of the Attalid king of [[Pergamon]] [[Eumenes II]] (197-133 BC). When his grandson [[Attalus III]] died without male children of his own, he left his kingdom to the [[Roman Republic]].

=== Roman period ===

[[File:Ephesus Theater.jpg|thumb|Theater.]]

[[File:Temple of Hadrian Ephesus 2.jpg|thumb|Temple of [[Hadrian]].]]

Ephesus a territory that was traditionally Greek to the core&lt;ref name=&quot; Makowiecka, Elżbieta 1978 62 &quot;&gt;{{cite book|author= Makowiecka, Elżbieta |title= The origin and evolution of architectural form of Roman library |publisher= Wydaw-a UW |year= 1978 |page=62 |oclc= 5099783 |quote= It was erected in Ephesus, in Asia Minor, in territory that was traditionally Greek to the core. That is why Celsus’ library in Ephesus represents very important element in tracing the development of Roman libraries. }}&lt;/ref&gt; became subject of the [[Roman Republic]]. The city felt at once the Roman influence. Taxes rose considerably, and the treasures of the city were systematically plundered. In 88 BC Ephesus welcomed [[Archelaus]], a general of [[Mithradates VI of Pontus|Mithridates the Great]], king of [[Pontus]], when he conquered Asia (the Roman name for western Asia Minor). This led to the [[Asiatic Vespers]], the slaughter of 80,000 Roman citizens in Asia, or any person who spoke with a Latin accent. Many had lived in Ephesus. But when they saw how badly the people of [[Chios]] had been treated by Zenobius, a general of Mithridates, they refused entry to his army. Zenobius was invited into the city to visit Philopoemen (the father of [[Monime]], the favorite wife of Mithridates) and the overseer of Ephesus. As the people expected nothing good of him, they threw him into prison and murdered him. Mithridates took revenge and inflicted terrible punishments. However, the Greek cities were given freedom and several substantial rights. Ephesus became, for a short time, self-governing. When Mithridates was defeated in the [[First Mithridatic War]] by the Roman consul [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], Ephesus came back under the Roman rule in 86 BC. Sulla imposed a huge indemnity, along with five years of back taxes, which left Asian cities heavily in debt for a long time to come.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mithridatic War&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_mithridatic_10.html|title=History of Rome: The Mithridatic Wars §§46-50|accessdate=2007-10-02|author=Appian of Alexandria (c.95 AD-c.165 AD)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Augustus]] became emperor in 27 BC, he made Ephesus instead of Pergamum the capital of [[Asia (Roman province)|proconsular Asia]], which covered western Asia Minor. Ephesus entered an era of prosperity. It became the seat of the governor, growing into a metropolis and a major center of commerce. It was second in importance and size only to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo . Geography (volume 1-7) 14.1.24. Cambridge: Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Ephesus has been estimated to be in the range of 400,000 to 500,000 inhabitants in the year 100, making it the largest city in Roman Asia and of the day. Ephesus was at its peak during the 1st and 2nd century AD.

The city was famed for the [[Temple of Artemis]] ([[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Turkey/_Periods/Greek/_Texts/LETGKB/Ephesus*.html |title=accessed September 14, 2007 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had her chief shrine there, the [[Library of Celsus]], and its theatre, which was capable of holding 25,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ring|first=Trudy|coauthors=Salkin, Robert|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=London|year=1995|page=217|chapter=Ephesus|isbn=9781884964022}}&lt;/ref&gt; This open-air theater was used initially for drama, but during later Roman times gladiatorial combats were also held on its stage, with the first archaeological evidence of a gladiator graveyard found in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kupper |first=Monika |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6614479.stm |title=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6614479.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Ephesus also had several major [[bath complexes]], built at various points while the city was under Roman rule. The city had one of the most advanced [[aqueduct]] systems in the ancient world, with multiple aqueducts of various sizes to supply different areas of the city, including 4 major aqueducts. They fed a multiple set of water mills, one of which has beeen identified as a [[sawmill]] for [[marble]]. 

The city and temple were destroyed by the [[Goths]] in 263 AD. This marked the decline of the city's splendor.

=== Byzantine era (395-1071) ===

Ephesus remained the most important city of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in Asia after [[Constantinople]] in the 5th and 6th centuries. The emperor [[Constantine I]] rebuilt much of the city and erected a new public bath. In 406 [[John Chrysostom]], archbishop of Constantinople, ordered the destruction of the Temple of Artemis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&amp;f=lovestories |title=Christian Persecutions against the Hellenes |publisher=Ysee.gr |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Arcadius|Flavius Arcadius]] raised the level of the street between the theatre and the harbour. The basilica of St. John was built during the reign of emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century.

The town was again partially destroyed by an earthquake in 614.

The importance of the city as a commercial center declined as the harbor was slowly silted up by the river (today, Küçük Menderes) despite repeated dredging during the city's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/ephesus.htm |title=accessed September 24, 2007 |publisher=Lexicorient.com |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Today, the harbor is 5 kilometers inland). The loss of its harbor caused Ephesus to lose its access to the [[Aegean Sea]], which was important for trade. People started leaving the lowland of the city for the surrounding hills. The ruins of the temples were used as building blocks for new homes. Marble sculptures were ground to powder to make lime for plaster.

Sackings by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Arabs]] first in the year 654-655 by [[caliph]] [[Muawiyah I]], and later in 700 and 716 hastened the decline further.

When the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] conquered Ephesus in 1090,&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Clive (1979) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=i6Q8AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Ephesus+after+antiquity:+a+late+antique,+Byzantine,+and+Turkish+city Ephesus after antiquity: a late antique, Byzantine, and Turkish city]'', Cambridge University Press, p. 121.&lt;br&gt;Gökovalı, Şadan; Altan Erguvan (1982) ''Ephesus'', Ticaret Matbaacılık, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; it was a small village. The Byzantines resumed control in 1100 and changed the name of the town to Hagios Theologos. They kept control of the region until 1308. Crusaders passing through were surprised that there was only a small village, called Ayasalouk, where they had expected a bustling city with a large seaport. Even the temple of Artemis was completely forgotten by the local population.

=== Turkish era ===

[[File:Selçuk Ayasoluk IsabeyMosque.jpg|thumb|[[İsa Bey Mosque]].]]

The town was conquered in 1304 by Sasa Bey, an army commander of the [[Menteşe|Menteşoğulları]] principality. Shortly afterwards, it was ceded to the [[Aydınoğlu|Aydınoğulları]] principality that stationed a powerful navy in the harbour of [[Selçuk|Ayasuluğ]] (the present-day [[Selçuk]], next to Ephesus). Ayasoluk became an important harbour, from whence the navy organised raids to the surrounding regions.

The town knew again a short period of flourishing during the 14th century under these new [[Seljuk]] rulers. They added important architectural works such as the [[İsa Bey Mosque]], caravansaries and [[Turkish bath]]houses (hamam).

They were incorporated as vassals into the [[Ottoman Empire]] for the first time in 1390. The Central Asian warlord [[Tamerlane]] defeated the Ottomans in Anatolia in 1402, and the Ottoman sultan [[Bayezid I]] died in captivity. The region was restored to the [[Anatolian beyliks]]. After a period of unrest, the region was again incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1425.

Ephesus was eventually completely abandoned in the 15th century and lost her former glory. Nearby Ayasuluğ was renamed Selçuk in 1914.

==Ephesus and Christianity==
{{see also|Early centers of Christianity#Anatolia|l1=Early centers of Christianity in Anatolia}}
[[File:House of the Virgin Mary.jpg|thumb|[[House of the Virgin Mary]]]]

Ephesus was an important center for [[Early Christianity]] from the AD 50s. From AD 52–54, [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] lived in Ephesus, working with the congregation and apparently organizing missionary activity into the hinterlands.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Paul, St.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He became embroiled in a dispute with artisans, whose livelihood depended on selling the statuettes of Artemis in the Temple of Artemis ({{Bible|Acts 19:23-41}}). He wrote between 53 and 57 AD the letter [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] from Ephesus (possibly from the &quot;Paul tower&quot; close to the harbour, where he was imprisoned for a short time). Later Paul wrote the [[Epistle to Ephesians]] while he was in prison in Rome (around 62 AD).

Roman Asia was associated with [[John the Apostle|John]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;&gt;[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]]. Caesar and Christ. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; one of the chief apostles, and the Gospel of John might have been written in Ephesus, ''c'' 90-100.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris Gospels&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. &quot;The Gospels&quot; p. 266-268&lt;/ref&gt; Ephesus was one of the [[Seven churches of the Book of Revelation|seven cities]] addressed in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] ({{Bible|Revelation 2:1-7}}), indicating that the church at Ephesus was strong.

Two decades later, the church at Ephesus was still important enough to be addressed by a letter written by Bishop [[Ignatius of Antioch]] to the Ephesians in the early 2nd century AD, that begins with, &quot;Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church which is at Ephesus, in Asia, deservedly most happy, being blessed in the greatness and fullness of God the Father, and predestinated before the beginning of time, that it should be always for an enduring and unchangeable glory&quot; (''Letter to the Ephesians''). The church at Ephesus had given their support for Ignatius, who was taken to Rome for execution.

The [[house of the Virgin Mary]], about {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Selçuk, is believed to have been the last home of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]]. It is a popular place of pilgrimage which has been visited by three recent [[pope]]s.

The [[Church of Mary]] close to the harbor of Ephesus was the setting for the [[First Council of Ephesus|Third Ecumenical Council]] in 431, which resulted in the condemnation of [[Nestorius]]. A [[Second Council of Ephesus]] was held in 449, but its controversial acts were never approved by the Catholics. It came to be called the Robber Council of Ephesus or Robber Synod of Latrocinium by its opponents.

Ephesus contains the largest collection of Roman ruins in the eastern Mediterranean. Only an estimated 15% has been excavated. The ruins that are visible give some idea of the city's original splendor, and the names associated with the ruins are evocative of its former life. The theater dominates the view down Harbour Street, which leads to the silted-up harbor.

Designed with an exaggerated entrance — so as to enhance its perceived size, speculate many historians — the building faces east so that the reading rooms could make best use of the morning light.

A part of the site, '''[[Basilica of St. John]]''', was built in the 6th century AD, under emperor [[Justinian I]] over the supposed site of the apostle's tomb. It is now surrounded by Selçuk.

The '''[[Temple of Artemis]]''', one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], is represented only by one inconspicuous column, revealed during an archaeological excavation by the [[British Museum]] in the 1870s. Some fragments of the [[frieze]] (which are insufficient to suggest the form of the original) and other small finds were removed – some to London and some to the Archaeological Museum, Istanbul.

The '''Odeon''' was a small roofed theater&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.iexplore.com/planning/journalEntryActivity.asp?JournalID=7393&amp;EntryID=13307&amp;n=The+Theater+and+The+Odeum |title=accessed September 24, 2007 |publisher=Community.iexplore.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed by Vedius Antonius and his wife around 150 AD. It was a small salon for plays and concerts, seating about 1,500 people. There were 22 stairs in the theater. The upper part of the theater was decorated with red granite pillars in the Corinthian style. The entrances were at both sides of the stage and reached by a few steps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Naci&quot;&gt;Keskin, Naci. ''Ephesus''. ISBN 975-7559-48-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Temple of Hadrian''' dates from the 2nd century but underwent repairs in the 4th century and has been reerected from the surviving architectural fragments. The reliefs in the upper sections are casts, the originals being now exhibited in the [[Ephesus Archaeological Museum]]. A number of figures are depicted in the reliefs, including the emperor [[Theodosius I]] with his wife and eldest son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revak&quot;/&gt; The temple was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 20 million [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknote of 2001-2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey].

The '''Temple of [[Domitian]]''' was one of the largest temples in the city. It was erected on a [[pseudodipteral]] plan with 8 x 13 columns. The temple and its statue are some of the few remains connected with [[Domitian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Revak&quot;/&gt;

At an estimated 44,000 seating capacity, the '''Theater''' is believed to be the largest outdoor theater in the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudy.org/biblepic/picture-of-largest-outdoor-theatre-in-ancient-world.html |title=accessed September 21, 2007 |publisher=Biblestudy.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tomb/Fountain of Pollio''' was erected in 97 AD in honor of C. Sextilius Pollio, who constructed the Marnas aqueduct, by Offilius Proculus. It has a concave facade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Naci&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Revak&quot;&gt;''Ephesus''. Distributed by Rehber Basım Yayın Dağıtım Reklamcılık ve Tic. A.Ş. and Revak publishers.

== Seven sleepers ==

Ephesus is believed to be the city of the [[Seven Sleepers]]. The story of the Seven Sleepers, who are considered saints by [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] and whose story is also mentioned in the [[Qur'an]], tells that they were persecuted because of their belief in God and that they slept in a cave near Ephesus for centuries.

== Archaeology ==

The history of archaeological research in Ephesus stretches back to 1863, when British architect [[John Turtle Wood]], sponsored by the [[British Museum]], began to search for the [[Artemision]]. In 1869 he discovered the pavement of the temple, but since further expected discoveries were not made the excavations stopped in 1874. In 1895 German archaeologist [[Otto Benndorf]], financed by a 10,000 guilder donation made by Austrian Karl Mautner Ritter von Markhof, resumed excavations. In 1898 Benndorf founded the [[Austrian Archaeological Institute]] which plays a leading role in Ephesus today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oeai.at/eng/ausland/geschichte.html|title=Ephesos - An Ancient Metropolis: Exploration and History|publisher=Austrian Archaeological Institute|date=October 2008|accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finds from the site are exhibited notably in the [[Ephesos Museum]] in Vienna, the [[Ephesus Archaeological Museum]] in Selçuk and in the British Museum.
