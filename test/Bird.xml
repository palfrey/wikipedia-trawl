'''Birds''' ([[Class (biology)|class]] '''Aves''') are [[feather]]ed, [[bird flight|wing]]ed, [[Bipedalism|biped]]al, [[Endotherm (biology)|endothermic]] ([[warm-blooded]]), [[egg (biology)|egg-laying]], [[vertebrate]] animals. There are around 10,000 living species, making them the most speciose class of [[tetrapod]] vertebrates. They inhabit ecosystems across the globe, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. [[Extant taxon|Extant]] birds range in size from the {{convert|5|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[Bee Hummingbird]] to the {{convert|2.75|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[Ostrich]]. The [[Paleontology|fossil record]] indicates that birds [[evolution|evolved]] from [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s during the [[Jurassic]] period, around 150–200 Ma (million years ago), and the earliest known bird is the Late Jurassic ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', ''c'' 150–145 Ma. Most [[paleontologist]]s regard birds as the only [[clade]] of dinosaurs to have survived the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]] approximately 65.5 Ma.

Modern birds are [[body plan|characterised]] by [[feather]]s, a [[beak]] with no [[teeth]], the [[Oviposition|laying]] of [[Eggshell|hard-shelled]] eggs, a high [[metabolism|metabolic]] rate, a four-chambered [[heart]], and a lightweight but strong [[Bird skeleton|skeleton]]. All ''living'' species of birds have wings - the now extinct flightless [[Moa]] of [[New Zealand]] were the only exceptions. Wings are [[evolution|evolved]] forelimbs, and most bird species can [[bird flight|fly]], with some exceptions including [[ratite]]s, [[penguin]]s, and a number of diverse [[Endemism in birds|endemic]] island species. Birds also have unique [[digestive system|digestive]] and [[respiratory system]]s that are highly adapted for flight. Some birds, especially [[corvids]] and [[parrots]], are among the most intelligent animal species; a number of bird species have been observed [[Tool use by animals|manufacturing and using tools]], and many social species exhibit cultural transmission of knowledge across generations.

Many species undertake long distance annual [[bird migration|migrations]], and many more perform shorter irregular movements. Birds are social; they communicate using visual signals and through calls and [[bird song|songs]], and participate in social behaviours including [[Helpers at the nest|cooperative breeding]] and hunting, [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]], and [[Mobbing behavior|mobbing]] of predators. The vast majority of bird species are [[socially monogamous]], usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are [[polygyny|polygynous]] (&quot;many females&quot;) or, rarely, [[polyandry|polyandrous]] (&quot;many males&quot;). Eggs are usually laid in a nest and [[Avian incubation|incubated]] by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.

Many species are of economic importance, mostly as sources of food acquired through hunting or farming. Some species, particularly [[songbird]]s and [[parrot]]s, are popular as pets. Other uses include the harvesting of [[guano]] (droppings) for use as a [[fertiliser]]. Birds [[List of fictional birds|figure prominently]] in all aspects of human culture from religion to poetry to popular music. About 120–130 species have become [[extinction|extinct]] as a result of human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Currently about 1,200 species of birds are threatened with extinction by human activities, though efforts are underway to [[bird conservation|protect]] them.

==Evolution and taxonomy==

[[File:Naturkundemuseum Berlin - Archaeopteryx - Eichstätt.jpg|alt= Slab of stone with fossil bones and feather impressions|thumb|right|''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', the earliest known bird]]
The first [[biological classification|classification]] of birds was developed by [[Francis Willughby]] and [[John Ray]] in their 1676 volume ''Ornithologiae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=del Hoyo |first=Josep |coauthors=Andy Elliott and Jordi Sargatal |title=[[Handbook of Birds of the World]], Volume 1: Ostrich to Ducks |year=1992 |publisher=[[Lynx Edicions]] |location=Barcelona |isbn=84-87334-10-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Carolus Linnaeus]] modified that work in 1758 to devise the [[taxonomic classification]] system currently in use.&lt;ref&gt;

Birds are categorised as the [[Class (biology)|biological class]] Aves in [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. [[Phylogenetic taxonomy]] places Aves in the dinosaur [[clade]] [[Theropoda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Theropoda&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Livezey |first=Bradley C. |month=January |year=2007 |title=Higher-order phylogeny of modern birds (Theropoda, Aves: Neornithes) based on comparative anatomy.

Aves and a sister group, the clade [[Crocodilia]], contain the only living representatives of the [[reptile]] clade [[Archosauria]]. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetically]], Aves is commonly defined as all descendants of the [[most recent common ancestor]] of modern birds and ''[[Archaeopteryx|Archaeopteryx lithographica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Padian|first=Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Padian|coauthor=L.M.

''Archaeopteryx'', from the [[Tithonian]] stage of the [[Late Jurassic]] (some {{Nowrap|150–145 million}} years ago), is the earliest known bird under this definition. Others, including [[Jacques Gauthier]] and adherents of the [[Phylocode]] system, have defined Aves to include only the modern bird groups, the [[crown group]].

All modern birds lie within the [[subclass (biology)|subclass]] [[Neornithes]], which has two subdivisions: the [[Palaeognathae]], containing birds that are flightless (like [[ostrich]]es) or weak fliers, and the wildly diverse [[Neognathae]], containing all other birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theropoda&quot;/&gt; These two subdivisions are often given the [[taxonomic rank|rank]] of [[superorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdbiogeography1.htm |title=Bird biogeography |accessdate=2008-04-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Bradley C.

===Dinosaurs and the origin of birds===
{{Main|Origin of birds}}
[[File:Confuchisornis sanctus.JPG|thumb|alt= White slab of rock left with cracks and impression of bird feathers and bone, including long paired tail feathers|''[[Confuciusornis]]'', a Cretaceous bird from China]]
Based on fossil and biological evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialized sub-group of [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[Dinosauria|dinosaurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prum|first=Richard O. Prum|title=Who's Your Daddy|journal=Science|volume=322|pages=1799–1800|year=2008|doi=10.1126/science.1168808|pmid=19095929|month= December|issue=5909|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, they are members of [[Maniraptora]], a group of theropods which includes [[dromaeosaur]]s and [[Oviraptoridae|oviraptorids]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Paul |first=Gregory S. |authorlink=Gregory S.

|pages=171–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; As scientists discover more non-avian theropods that are closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. Recent discoveries in the [[Liaoning]] Province of northeast China, which demonstrate that many small [[Feathered dinosaurs|theropod dinosaurs had feathers]], contribute to this ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Norell |first=Mark |coauthors=Mick Ellison |year=2005 |title=Unearthing the Dragon: The Great Feathered Dinosaur Discovery |location=New York

The consensus view in contemporary [[paleontology]] is that the birds, Aves, are the closest relatives of the [[deinonychosaur]]s, which include [[dromaeosaurid]]s and [[troodontid]]s. Together, these three form a group called [[Paraves]]. The [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] dromaeosaur ''[[Microraptor]]'' has features which may have enabled it to glide or fly. The most basal deinonychosaurs are very small. This evidence raises the possibility that the ancestor of all paravians may have been [[arboreal]], may have been able to glide, or both.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHTetal07&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner |first=Alan H. |year=2007 |title=A basal dromaeosaurid and size evolution preceding avian flight |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/317/5843/1378.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=317 |pages=1378–1381 |doi=10.1126/science.1144066 |pmid=17823350 |month= September|issue=5843 |issn=0036-8075 |last2=Pol |first2=D |last3=Clarke |first3=JA |last4=Erickson |first4=GM |last5=Norell |first5=MA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;xuetal2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Xing, X., Zhou, Z., Wang, X., Kuang, X., Zhang, F., and Du, X.|year=2003|title=Four-winged dinosaurs from China|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=421|issue=6921|pages=335–340|doi=10.1038/nature01342|pmid=12540892|month= January|last1=Xu|first1=X|last2=Zhou|first2=Z|last3=Wang|first3=X|last4=Kuang|first4=X|last5=Zhang|first5=F|last6=Du|first6=X|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Late Jurassic]] ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' is well-known as one of the first [[transitional fossil]]s to be found and it provided support for the theory of [[evolution]] in the late 19th century. ''Archaeopteryx'' has clearly reptilian characteristics: teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like tail, but it has finely preserved wings with flight feathers identical to those of modern birds. It is not considered a direct ancestor of modern birds, but is the oldest and most primitive known member of Aves or [[Avialae]], and it is probably closely related to the real ancestor.&lt;ref name =&quot;mayretal2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.2006.00245.x | last1 = Mayr | first1 = G. | last2 = Phol | first2 = B. | last3 = Hartman | first3 = S. | last4 = Peters | first4 = D.S. | year = 2007 | title = The tenth skeletal specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'' | url = | journal = Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 149 | issue = | pages = 97–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative theories and controversies===
There have been many controversies in the study of the origin of birds. Early disagreements included whether birds evolved from [[dinosaur]]s or more primitive [[archosaur]]s. Within the dinosaur camp there were disagreements as to whether [[ornithischia]]n or [[theropod]] dinosaurs were the more likely ancestors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heilmann1927&quot;&gt;Heilmann, Gerhard (1927). ''The Origin of Birds''. New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaurs share the hip structure of modern birds, birds are thought to have originated from the [[saurischia]]n (lizard-hipped) dinosaurs, and therefore evolved their hip structure [[Convergent evolution|independently]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rasskin-Gutman |first=Diego |month=March |year=2001 |title=Theoretical morphology of the Archosaur (Reptilia: Diapsida) pelvic girdle |journal=[[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=59–78|doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2001)027&lt;0059:TMOTAR&gt;2.0.CO;2 |last2=Buscalioni |first2=Angela D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, a bird-like hip structure evolved a third time among a peculiar group of theropods known as the [[Therizinosauridae]]. A few scientists suggest that birds are not dinosaurs, but evolved from early archosaurs like ''[[Longisquama]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feduccia |first=Alan |month=November |year=2005|title=Do feathered dinosaurs exist?

Birds diversified into a wide variety of forms during the [[Cretaceous Period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chiappe2007&quot;/&gt; Many groups retained [[symplesiomorphy|primitive characteristics]], such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of bird groups, including [[modern birds]] (Neornithes). While the earliest forms, such as ''Archaeopteryx'' and ''[[Jeholornis]]'', retained the long bony tails of their ancestors,&lt;ref name=&quot;chiappe2007&quot;/&gt; the tails of more advanced birds were shortened with the advent of the [[pygostyle]] bone in the [[clade]] Pygostylia.

The first large, diverse lineage of short-tailed birds to evolve were the [[Enantiornithes]], or &quot;opposite birds&quot;, so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds. Enantiornithes occupied a wide array of ecological niches, from sand-probing shorebirds and fish-eaters to tree-dwelling forms and seed-eaters.&lt;ref name=&quot;chiappe2007&quot;/&gt; More advanced lineages also specialised in eating fish, like the superficially [[gull]]-like subclass of [[Ichthyornithes]] (&quot;fish birds&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal|last=Clarke |first=Julia A. |coauthors= |month=September |year=2004 |title=Morphology, Phylogenetic Taxonomy, and Systematics of ''Ichthyornis'' and ''Apatornis'' (Avialae: Ornithurae) |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |volume=286 |pages=1–179 |doi= 10.1206/0003-0090(2004)286&lt;0001:MPTASO&gt;2.0.CO;2|url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/454/1/B286.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One order of Mesozoic seabirds, the [[Hesperornithiformes]], became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic. Despite their extreme specializations, the Hesperornithiformes represent some of the closest relatives of modern birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;chiappe2007&quot;/&gt;

The paleognaths include the [[tinamou]]s of [[Central America|Central]] and South America and the [[ratite]]s. The basal divergence from the remaining Neognathes was that of the [[Galloanserae]], the superorder containing the [[Anseriformes]] ([[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s and [[screamer]]s) and the [[Galliformes]] (the [[pheasant]]s, [[grouse]], and their allies, together with the [[mound builder (bird)|mound builders]] and the [[guan (bird)|guan]]s and their allies). The dates for the splits are much debated by scientists. It is agreed that the Neornithes evolved in the Cretaceous, and that the split between the Galloanseri from other Neognathes occurred before the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|K–T extinction event]], but there are different opinions about whether the [[Evolutionary radiation|radiation]] of the remaining Neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ericson&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ericson |first=Per G.P. |month=December |year=2006 |title=Diversification of Neoaves: Integration of molecular sequence data and fossils |journal=[[Biology Letters]] |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=543–547 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0523 |pmid=17148284 |url=http://www.senckenberg.de/files/content/forschung/abteilung/terrzool/ornithologie/neoaves.pdf|format=PDF |issn=1744-9561 |last2=Anderson |first2=CL |last3=Britton |first3=T |last4=Elzanowski |first4=A |last5=Johansson |first5=US |last6=Källersjö |first6=M |last7=Ohlson |first7=JI |last8=Parsons |first8=TJ |last9=Zuccon |first9=D |pmc=1834003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation, while [[fossil]] evidence supports a [[Tertiary]] radiation.

The classification of birds is a contentious issue.

This is a list of the taxonomic orders in the subclass Neornithes, or modern birds. This list uses the traditional classification (the so-called [[James Clements|Clements]] order), revised by the Sibley-Monroe classification. The [[list of birds]] gives a more detailed summary of the orders, including families.

'''Subclass Neornithes'''&lt;br/&gt;
The subclass Neornithes has two [[superorder]]s&amp;nbsp;–

Superorder [[Palaeognathae]]:

The name of the superorder is derived from 'paleognath', the ancient Greek for &quot;old jaws&quot; in reference to the skeletal anatomy of the palate, which is described as more primitive and reptilian than that in other birds. The Palaeognathae consists of two orders which comprise 49 existing species.

* [[Struthioniformes]]—[[ostrich]]es, [[emu]]s, [[kiwi]]s, and allies
* [[Tinamiformes]]—tinamous

Superorder [[Neognathae]]:

The superorder Neognathae comprises 27 orders which have a total of nearly ten thousand species.
The Neognathae have undergone [[adaptive radiation]] to produce the staggering diversity of form (especially of the bill and feet), function, and behavior that are seen today.

The orders comprising the Neognathae are:
[[Image:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|[[Moa]] attacked by a [[Haast's Eagle]]]]
* [[Anseriformes]]—waterfowl
* [[Galliformes]]—fowl
* [[Charadriiformes]]—[[gull]]s, [[button-quail]]s, [[plover]]s and allies
* [[Gaviiformes]]—loons
* [[Podicipediformes]]—grebes
* [[Procellariiformes]]—[[albatross]]es, [[petrel]]s, and allies
* [[Sphenisciformes]]—penguins
* [[Pelecaniformes]]—[[pelican]]s and allies
* [[Phaethontiformes]]—tropicbirds
* [[Ciconiiformes]]—[[stork]]s and allies
* [[Cathartiformes]]—New World vultures
* [[Phoenicopteriformes]]—flamingos
* [[Falconiformes]]—[[falcon]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s and allies
* [[Gruiformes]]—[[Crane (bird)|cranes]] and allies
* [[Pteroclidiformes]]—sandgrouse
* [[Columbiformes]]—[[Columbidae|doves and pigeons]]
* [[parrot|Psittaciformes]]—[[parrot]]s and allies
* [[Cuculiformes]]—[[cuckoo]]s and [[turaco]]s
* [[Opisthocomiformes]]—hoatzin
* [[owl|Strigiformes]]—owls
* [[Caprimulgiformes]]—[[nightjar]]s and allies
* [[Apodiformes]]—[[swift]]s and [[hummingbird]]s
* [[Coraciiformes]]—[[kingfisher]]s and allies
* [[Piciformes]]—[[woodpecker]]s and allies
* [[Trogoniformes]]—trogons
* [[Coliiformes]]—mousebirds
* [[Passerine|Passeriformes]]—passerines

The radically different Sibley-Monroe classification ([[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]]), based on molecular data, found widespread adoption in a few aspects, as recent molecular, fossil, and anatomical evidence supported the [[Galloanserae]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Ericson&quot;/&gt;

Compared with other vertebrates, birds have a [[body plan]] that shows many unusual adaptations, mostly to facilitate [[bird flight|flight]].

The skeleton consists of very lightweight bones. They have large air-filled cavities (called pneumatic cavities) which connect with the [[respiratory system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ehrlich |first=Paul R. |coauthors=David S.

Like the [[reptile]]s, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their [[kidney]]s extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as [[uric acid]] instead of [[urea]] or [[ammonia]] via the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a [[urinary bladder]] or external urethral opening and (with exception of the [[Ostrich#Description|Ostrich]]) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ehrlich |first=Paul R. |coauthors=David S.

===Chromosomes===
Birds have two sexes: male and female. The sex of birds is determined by the [[ZW sex-determination system|Z and W sex chromosomes]], rather than by the X and Y chromosomes present in mammals. Male birds have two Z chromosomes (ZZ), and female birds have a W chromosome and a Z chromosome (WZ).&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt;

In nearly all species of birds, an individual's sex is determined at fertilization. However, one recent study demonstrated [[temperature-dependent sex determination]] among [[Australian Brush-turkeys]], for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male [[sex ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Göth|first=Anne|title=Incubation temperatures and sex ratios in Australian brush-turkey (''Alectura lathami'') mounds|journal=Austral Ecology|year=2007|volume=32|issue=4|pages=278–85|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01709.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feathers are a feature characteristic of birds (though also present in [[Feathered dinosaurs|some dinosaurs]] not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate [[bird flight|flight]], provide insulation that aids in [[thermoregulation]], and are used in display, camouflage, and signaling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; There are several types of feathers, each serving its own set of purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called [[plumage]], may vary within species by age, [[social status]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belthoff |first=James R. |date=1 August 1994|title=Plumage Variation, Plasma Steroids and Social Dominance in Male House Finches |journal=The Condor |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=614–25 |doi=10.2307/1369464 |issn=00105422 |author2=Dufty, |author3=Gauthreaux,}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexual dimorphism|sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Guthrie| first=R.

Plumage is regularly [[moult]]ed; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the &quot;non-breeding&quot; plumage, or&amp;nbsp;– in the [[Humphrey-Parkes terminology]]&amp;nbsp;– &quot;basic&quot; plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as &quot;alternate&quot; plumages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphrey |first=Philip S. |date=1 June 1959|title=An approach to the study of molts and plumages |journal=The Auk |volume=76 |pages=1–31 |url=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v076n01/p0001-p0031.pdf |doi=10.2307/3677029|format=PDF |issn=09088857 |issue=2 |jstor=3677029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, [[flight feather]]s are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap.&lt;ref name=&quot;pettingill&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Pettingill Jr. OS|year=1970|title=Ornithology in Laboratory and Field|isbn=808716093|publisher=Burgess Publishing Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight feathers at once, temporarily becoming flightless.&lt;ref name=&quot;debeeretal&quot;&gt;de Beer SJ, Lockwood GM, Raijmakers JHFS, Raijmakers JMH, Scott WA, Oschadleus HD, Underhill LG (2001).

The [[Bird anatomy#Scales|scales]] of birds are composed of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs.

Most birds can [[Flying and gliding animals|fly]], which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb ([[wing]]) that serves as an [[airfoil|aerofoil]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight.

===Migration===
{{Main|Bird migration}}
Many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of [[season]]al temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, [[shorebird]]s, and [[waterbird]]s undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the [[temperate]] or [[arctic]]/[[antarctic]] regions and a non-breeding season in the [[tropical]] regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.&lt;ref name = &quot;Battley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Klaassen&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klaassen |first=Marc |coauthors= |date=1 January 1996|title=Metabolic constraints on long-distance migration in birds |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |issue=1 |pages=57–64 |pmid=9317335 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/199/1/57 |issn=0022-0949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling.

Some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food. [[wiktionary:irruptive|Irruptive]] species such as the boreal [[finch]]es are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next.

The ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s a [[Manx Shearwater]] released in [[Boston]] returned to its colony in [[Skomer]], [[Wales]], within 13 days, a distance of {{convert|5150|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews |first=G.

===Flocking and other associations===
While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large [[flock (birds)|flocks]]. The principal benefits of flocking are [[safety in numbers]] and increased foraging efficiency.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; Defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, where [[ambush predation]] is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system.

The high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times.

Many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their [[beak|bills]] in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. [[Passerine|Perching birds]] have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees.

====Territories, nesting and incubation====
{{See also|Bird nest}}
Many birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as [[seabird]]s and [[swift]]s, often breed in [[Bird colony|colonies]] instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kokko | first1 = H | last2 = Harris | first2 = M | last3 = Wanless | first3 = S | year = 2004 | title = Competition for breeding sites and site-dependent population regulation in a highly colonial seabird, the common guillemot ''Uria aalge''&quot;. | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 73 | issue = 2| pages = 367–76 | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00813.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All birds lay [[amniotic egg]]s with hard shells made mostly of [[calcium carbonate]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay [[camouflage]]d eggs. There are many exceptions to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting [[nightjar]]s have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of [[brood parasites]] have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Booker | first1 = L | last2 = Booker | first2 = M | year = 1991 | title = Why Are Cuckoos Host Specific? | url = http://jstor.org/stable/3565958| journal = [[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 301–09 | doi = 10.2307/3565958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Golden-backed Weaver.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Yellow weaver (bird) with black head hangs an upside-down nest woven out of grass fronds.|Male [[Golden-backed Weaver]]s construct elaborate suspended nests out of grass]]
Bird eggs are usually laid in a [[Bird nest|nest]]. Most species create somewhat elaborate nests, which can be cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hansell&quot;&gt;Hansell M (2000). ''Bird Nests and Construction Behaviour''. University of Cambridge Press ISBN 0-521-46038-7&lt;/ref&gt; Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; [[albatross]] nests are no more than a scrape on the ground. Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open nests. During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lafuma | first1 = L | last2 = Lambrechts | first2 = M | last3 = Raymond | first3 = M | year = 2001 | title = Aromatic plants in bird nests as a protection against [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] flying insects? | url = | journal = Behavioural Processes | volume = 56 | issue = 2| pages = 113–20 | doi = 10.1016/S0376-6357(01)00191-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and feathers are often used for nest insulation.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hansell&quot;/&gt; Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting [[Common Guillemot]] lays its eggs on bare rock, and male [[Emperor Penguin]]s keep eggs between their body and feet. The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are [[precocial]].

Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through [[brood patch]]es, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as {{convert|83|g}} of body weight per day of incubation.&lt;ref&gt;Warham, J. (1990) ''The Petrels&amp;nbsp;– Their Ecology and Breeding Systems'' London: [[Academic Press]] ISBN 0-12-735420-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of [[megapode]]s comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.&lt;ref&gt;Jones DN, Dekker, René WRJ, Roselaar, Cees S (1995). ''The Megapodes''. Bird Families of the World 3. [[Oxford University Press]]: Oxford. ISBN 0-19-854651-3&lt;/ref&gt; Incubation periods range from 10 days (in [[woodpecker]]s, [[cuckoo]]s and [[passerine]] birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and [[kiwi]]s).&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt;

====Parental care and fledging====
At the time of their hatching, chicks range in development from helpless to independent, depending on their species. Helpless chicks are termed ''[[altricial]]'', and tend to be born small, [[Blindness|blind]], immobile and naked; chicks that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed ''[[precocial]]''. Altricial chicks need help [[thermoregulation|thermoregulating]] and must be brooded for longer than precocial chicks. Chicks at neither of these extremes can be semi-precocial or semi-altricial.
[[File:Calliope-nest edit.jpg|thumb|alt= Hummingbird perched on edge of tiny nest places food into mouth of one of two chicks|left|A female [[Calliope Hummingbird]] feeding fully grown chicks]]

The length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in [[megapode]]s ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot A (1994). &quot;Family Megapodiidae (Megapodes)&quot; in ''[[Handbook of the Birds of the World]]. Volume 2; New World Vultures to Guineafowl'' (eds del Hoyo J, Elliott A, Sargatal J)  Lynx Edicions:Barcelona. ISBN 84-87337-15-6&lt;/ref&gt; At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the [[Great Frigatebird]], whose chicks take up to six months to [[fledge]] and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months.&lt;ref&gt;Metz VG, Schreiber EA (2002). &quot;Great Frigatebird (''Fregata minor'')&quot; In ''The Birds of North America, No 681'', (Poole, A. and Gill, F., eds) The Birds of North America Inc: Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt;

In some species, both parents care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the responsibility of only one sex. In some species, [[helpers at the nest|other member]]s of the same species&amp;mdash;usually close relatives of the [[breeding pair]], such as offspring from previous broods&amp;mdash;will help with the raising of the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = J | year = 2006 | title = Family living amongst birds | url = | journal = [[Journal of Avian Biology]] | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 289–98 | doi = 10.1111/j.2006.0908-8857.03666.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such alloparenting is particularly common among the [[Corvida]], which includes such birds as the true [[Corvidae|crows]], [[Australian Magpie]] and [[Fairy-wren]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Cockburn A|editor=Floyd R, Sheppard A, de Barro P|title=Frontiers in Population Ecology|year=1996|publisher=CSIRO|location=Melbourne|isbn= |pages=21–42|chapter=Why do so many Australian birds cooperate? Social evolution in the Corvida}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been observed in species as different as the [[Rifleman (bird)|Rifleman]] and [[Red Kite]]. Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common&amp;mdash;more so than in any other vertebrate class.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a [[division of labour]] in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cockburn|first=Andrew|year=2006|title=Prevalence of different modes of parental care in birds |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3458|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences|volume=273|issue=1592|pages=1375–83|pmid=16777726|month= June|issn=0962-8452|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16777726|format=Free full text|pmc=1560291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The point at which chicks [[fledge]] varies dramatically. The chicks of the ''[[Synthliboramphus]]'' murrelets, like the [[Ancient Murrelet]], leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators.&lt;ref&gt;Gaston AJ (1994). Ancient Murrelet (''Synthliboramphus antiquus''). In ''The Birds of North America, No. 132'' (A. Poole and F. Gill, Eds.). Philadelphia: The Academy of Natural Sciences; Washington, D.C.: The American Ornithologists' Union.&lt;/ref&gt; Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, they are able to fly. The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schaefer | first1 = HC | last2 = Eshiamwata | first2 = GW | last3 = Munyekenye | first3 = FB | last4 = Bohning-Gaese | first4 = K | year = 2004 | title = Life-history of two African ''Sylvia'' warblers: low annual fecundity and long post-fledging care | url = | journal = [[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]] | volume = 146 | issue = 3| pages = 427–37 | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.2004.00276.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicks may also follow their parents during their first [[bird migration|migration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alonso | first1 = JC | last2 = Bautista | first2 = LM | last3 = Alonso | first3 = JA | year = 2004 | title = Family-based territoriality vs flocking in wintering common cranes ''Grus grus''&quot;. | url = | journal = [[Journal of Avian Biology]] | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 434–44 | doi = 10.1111/j.0908-8857.2004.03290.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brood parasitism]], in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than any other type of organism.&lt;ref name = &quot;brood&quot;&gt;Davies N (2000). ''Cuckoos, Cowbirds and other Cheats''. [[T. &amp; A. D. Poyser]]: London ISBN 0-85661-135-2&lt;/ref&gt; After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either ''obligate brood parasites'', which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or ''non-obligate brood parasites'', which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of [[conspecific]]s to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/beheco/8.2.153 | last1 = Sorenson | first1 = M | year = 1997 | title = Effects of intra- and interspecific brood parasitism on a precocial host, the canvasback, ''Aythya valisineria'' | url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/8/2/153.pdf | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 153–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred bird species, including [[honeyguide]]s, [[icterid]]s, [[estrildid finch]]es and [[Black-headed Duck|ducks]], are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the [[cuckoo]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;brood&quot;/&gt; Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Spottiswoode| first1=C.

Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions.&lt;ref name = &quot;flycatcher&quot;/&gt; While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the [[Ecological niche|niche]]s occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the [[forest canopy]], others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be [[insectivore]]s, [[frugivore]]s, and [[nectarivore]]s. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or [[kleptoparasitism]]. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised [[scavenger]]s. [[Avivore]]s are animals that are specialized at predating birds.

Some nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators, and many frugivores play a key role in seed dispersal.&lt;ref name = &quot;Clout&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clout | first1 = M | last2 = Hay | first2 = J | year = 1989 | title = The importance of birds as browsers, pollinators and seed dispersers in New Zealand forests | url = http://www.newzealandecology.org/nzje/free_issues/NZJEcol12_s_27.pdf | journal = New Zealand Journal of Ecology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 27–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants and pollinating birds often [[coevolution|coevolve]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gary Stiles | first1=F. | title=Geographical Aspects of Bird-Flower Coevolution, with Particular Reference to Central America | url=http://jstor.org/stable/2398801 | journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden | volume=68 | issue=2 | pages=323–51 | year=1981 |doi= 10.2307/2398801}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases a flower's primary pollinator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Temeles | first1 = E | last2 = Linhart | first2 = Y | last3 = Masonjones | first3 = M | last4 = Masonjones | first4 = H | year = 2002 | title = The Role of Flower Width in Hummingbird Bill Length–Flower Length Relationships | url = http://www.amherst.edu/~ejtemeles/Temeles%20et%20al%202002%20biotropica.pdf | journal = Biotropica | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 68–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds are often important to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfill ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the [[moa]]s were important browsers, as are the [[New Zealand Pigeon|Kereru]] and [[Kokako]] today.&lt;ref name = &quot;Clout&quot;/&gt; Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bond | first1=William J. | last2=Lee | first2=William G. | last3=Craine | first3=Joseph M. | title=Plant structural defences against browsing birds: a legacy of New Zealand's extinct moas | journal=Oikos | volume=104 | pages=500–08 | year=2004 | doi = 10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12720.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nesting [[seabird]]s may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of [[guano]], which may enrich the local soil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wainright | first1 = S | last2 = Haney | first2 = J | last3 = Kerr | first3 = C | last4 = Golovkin | first4 = A | last5 = Flint | first5 = M | year = 1998 | title = Utilization of nitrogen derived from seabird guano by terrestrial and marine plants at St. Paul, Pribilof Islands, Bering Sea, Alaska | url = http://www.springerlink.com/index/DN8D70RYM7TUF42P.pdf | journal = Marine Ecology | volume = 131 | issue = 1| pages = 63–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the surrounding seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3354/meps032247 | last1 = Bosman | first1 = A | last2 = Hockey | first2 = A | year = 1986 | title = Seabird guano as a determinant of rocky intertidal community structure | url = http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/32/m032p247.pdf | journal = Marine Ecology Progress Series | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 247–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic importance===
Domesticated birds raised for meat and eggs, called [[poultry]], are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans; in 2003, {{Nowrap|76 million}} tons of poultry and {{Nowrap|61 million}} tons of eggs were produced worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/Out/Ote3_3.htm|title= Shifting protein sources: Chapter 3: Moving Up the Food Chain Efficiently.|publisher=

Many species of birds are also hunted for meat. Bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas. The most important birds hunted in North and South America are waterfowl; other widely hunted birds include [[pheasant]]s, [[turkey (bird)|wild turkeys]], [[quail]], [[dove]]s, [[partridge]], [[grouse]], [[snipe]], and [[woodcock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | unused_data = DUPLICATE DATA: url = | last1 = Simeone | first1 = A | last2 = Navarro | first2 = X | year = 2002 | title = Human exploitation of seabirds in coastal southern Chile during the mid-Holocene | url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0716-078X2002000200012&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en | journal = Rev.

Other commercially valuable products from birds include feathers (especially the [[Down feather|down]] of geese and ducks), which are used as insulation in clothing and bedding, and seabird feces ([[guano]]), which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen. The [[War of the Pacific]], sometimes called the Guano War, was fought in part over the control of guano deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/19cen/guanowar.html|title= The Guano War of 1865–1866.|publisher= World History at KMLA|accessdate= 18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes. Colourful birds, such as [[Parrot (family)|parrots]] and [[myna]]s, are bred in [[aviculture|captivity]] or kept as pets, a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0030605306000056 | last1 = Cooney | first1 = R | last2 = Jepson | first2 = P | year = 2006 | title = The international wild bird trade: what's wrong with blanket bans? | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=409231 | journal = Oryx | volume = 40 | issue = 1| pages = 18–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Falcon]]s and [[cormorant]]s have long been used for [[Falconry|hunting]] and fishing, respectively. [[Messenger pigeon]]s, used since at least 1&amp;nbsp;AD, remained important as recently as [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. Today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/4140937 | last1 = Manzi | first1 = M | last2 = Coomes | year = 2002 | first2 = O.

===Religion, folklore and culture===

Birds play prominent and diverse roles in folklore, religion, and [[popular culture]]. In religion, birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a [[deity]], such as in the Cult of [[Makemake (mythology)|Makemake]], in which the [[Tangata manu]] of [[Easter Island]] served as chiefs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Routledge | first1 = S | last2 = Routledge | first2 = K | year = 1917 | title = The Bird Cult of Easter Island | url = | journal = Folklore | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 337–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as attendants, as in the case of [[Hugin and Munin]], two [[Common Raven]]s who whispered news into the ears of the [[Norse god]] [[Odin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Lukas | first1= SE | last2= Benedikt | first2= R | last3= Mendelson | first3= JH | last4= Kouri | first4= E | last5= Sholar | first5= M | last6= Amass | first6= L | title= Marihuana attenuates the rise in plasma ethanol levels in human subjects. | journal= Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume= 7 | issue= 1 | pages= 77–81 | year= 1992 | pmid= 1326277 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0040014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priests were involved in [[augur]]y, or interpreting the words of birds while the &quot;auspex&quot; (from which the word &quot;auspicious&quot; is derived) watched their activities to foretell events.&lt;ref&gt;Ingersoll, Ernest (1923). [http://www.archive.org/details/birdsinlegendfab00inge Archive.org], &quot;Birds in legend, fable and folklore&quot;. Longmans, Green and co. p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; They may also serve as [[Religious symbolism|religious symbols]], as when [[Jonah]] (Hebrew: '''יוֹנָה''', [[dove]]) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Hauser| first1= A.

''Extinct Birds of New Zealand'' Te Papa Press, Wellington ISBN 978-0-909010-21-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds have been featured in culture and art since prehistoric times, when they were represented in early [[cave painting]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Meighan | first1=C. W. | title=Prehistoric Rock Paintings in Baja California | url=http://jstor.org/stable/2694739 | journal=American Antiquity | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=372–92 | year=1966 |doi= 10.2307/2694739}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds were later used in religious or symbolic art and design, such as the magnificent [[Peacock Throne]] of the [[Mughal era|Mughal]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] emperors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = CP | year = 1908 | title = A Pedestal of the Platform of the Peacock Throne | url = http://jstor.org/stable/3252550| journal = The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin | volume = 3 | issue = 10| pages = 182–83 | doi = 10.2307/3252550 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of birds were commissioned for books. Among the most famous of these bird artists was [[John James Audubon]], whose paintings of [[List of North American birds|North American birds]] were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the [[National Audubon Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Boime | first1=Albert | title=John James Audubon: a birdwatcher's fanciful flights | journal=Art History | volume=22 | pages=728–55 | year=1999 |doi= 10.1111/1467-8365.00184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, [[Homer]] incorporated [[Nightingale]]s into his ''[[Odyssey]]'', and [[Catullus]] used a [[sparrow]] as an erotic symbol in his [[Catullus 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chandler | first1 = A | year = 1934 | title = The Nightingale in Greek and Latin Poetry | url = | journal = The Classical Journal | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 78–84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between an [[albatross]] and a sailor is the central theme of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s [[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]], which led to the use of the [[Albatross (metaphor)|term as a metaphor for a 'burden']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Lasky | first1= E.

Perceptions of various bird species often vary across cultures. [[Owl]]s are associated with bad luck, [[witchcraft]], and death in parts of Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Enriquez PL, Mikkola H (1997). &quot;Comparative study of general public owl knowledge in Costa Rica, Central America and Malawi, Africa&quot;. pp. 160–66 In: J.R. Duncan, D.H. Johnson, T.H. Nicholls, (Eds). ''Biology and conservation of owls of the Northern Hemisphere.

Retrieved on 15 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hoopoe]]s were considered sacred in [[Ancient Egypt]] and symbols of virtue in [[Persia]], but were thought of as thieves across much of Europe and harbingers of war in [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dupree | first1 = N | year = 1974 | title = An Interpretation of the Role of the Hoopoe in Afghan Folklore and Magic | url = | journal = Folklore | volume = 85 | issue = 3| pages = 173–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===

Though human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species, such as the [[Barn Swallow]] and [[European Starling]], they have caused population decreases or [[extinction]] in many other species. Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times,&lt;ref&gt;Fuller E (2000). ''Extinct Birds'' (2nd ed.). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, New York. ISBN 0-19-850837-9&lt;/ref&gt; although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750–1800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of [[Melanesia]]n, [[Polynesia]]n, and [[Micronesia]]n islands.&lt;ref&gt;Steadman D (2006). ''Extinction and Biogeography in Tropical Pacific Birds'', University of Chicago Press. ISBN 978-0-226-77142-7&lt;/ref&gt; Many bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,227 species listed as [[threatened species|threatened]] by [[Birdlife International]] and the [[IUCN]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=BirdLife International announces more Critically Endangered birds than ever before |publisher=[[Birdlife International]] |date=14 May 2009 |url=http://www.birdlife.org/news/pr/2009/05/red_list.html |accessdate=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8045971.stm |first=Mark |last=Kinver |title=Birds at risk reach record high |publisher= BBC News Online |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Conserving Bird Biodiversity: General Principles and their Application'' Cambridge University Press.

Governments and [[conservation biology|conservation]] groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that [[In-situ conservation|preserve]] and [[ecological restoration|restore]] bird habitat or by establishing [[Ex-situ conservation|captive populations]] for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the [[California Condor]] and [[Norfolk Parakeet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0030605306000950 | last1 = Butchart | first1 = S | last2 = Stattersfield | first2 = A | last3 = Collar | first3 = N | year = 2006 | title = How many bird extinctions have we prevented? | url = http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/08/butchart_et_al_2006.pdf | journal = Oryx | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 266–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
