==Early life==
[[File:David - Portrait of Monsieur Lavoisier and His Wife.jpg|thumb|''[[Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]], ca. 1788]]
Born to a wealthy family in Paris, Antoine Laurent Lavoisier inherited a large fortune at the age of five with the passing of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations|Collège Mazarin]] in 1754 to 1761, studying [[chemistry]], [[botany]], [[astronomy]], and [[mathematics]]. His education was filled with the ideals of the French [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the time, and he felt fascination for [[Pierre Macquer]]'s dictionary of chemistry. He attended lectures in the natural sciences. Lavoisier's devotion and passion for chemistry was largely influenced by [[Étienne Condillac]], a prominent French scholar of the 18th century. His first chemical publication appeared in 1764. In collaboration with [[Jean-Étienne Guettard]], Lavoisier worked on a geological survey of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] in June 1767. At the age of 25, he was elected a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], France's most elite scientific society, for an essay on [[street lighting]], and in recognition for his earlier research. In 1769, he worked on the first geological map of France.

In 1771, at the age of 28, Lavoisier married 13-year-old [[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze]], the daughter of a co-owner of the ''[[Ferme générale]]''. Over time, she proved to be a scientific colleague to her husband. She translated documents from English for him, including [[Richard Kirwan]]'s ''Essay on Phlogiston'' and [[Joseph Priestley]]'s research. She created many [[drawing|sketches]] and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by Lavoisier and his colleagues. She edited and published Lavoisier’s memoirs (whether any English translations of those memoirs have survived is unknown as of today) and hosted parties at which eminent scientists discussed ideas and problems related to chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eagle |first=Cassandra T. |coauthors=Jennifer Sloan |title=Marie Anne Paulze Lavoisier: The Mother of Modern Chemistry |journal=The Chemical Educator |year=1998 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=1&amp;nbsp;– 18 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x14v35m5n8822v42/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-12-14 |doi=10.1007/s00897980249a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to chemistry==
===Research on gases, water, and combustion===
[[File:Lavoisier decomposition air.png|thumb|Antoine Lavoisier's famous phlogiston experiment. Engraving by [[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze|Mme Lavoisier]] in the 1780s taken from ''Traité élémentaire de chimie'' (Elementary treatise on chemistry)]]

[[File:SeimiKaisouChemistry.jpg|thumb|upright|The work of Lavoisier was translated in Japan in the 1840s, through the process of [[Rangaku]]. Page from [[Udagawa Yōan]]'s 1840 ''Seimi Kaisō'']]

Lavoisier demonstrated the role of oxygen in the rusting of metal, as well as oxygen's role in animal and plant respiration. Working with [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], Lavoisier conducted experiments that showed that respiration was essentially a slow combustion of organic material using inhaled oxygen. Lavoisier's explanation of combustion disproved the [[phlogiston]] theory, which postulated that materials released a substance called phlogiston when they burned.

Lavoisier discovered that [[Henry Cavendish]]'s &quot;inflammable air&quot;, which Lavoisier had termed ''hydrogen'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for &quot;water-former&quot;), combined with oxygen to produce a dew which, as Joseph Priestley had reported, appeared to be water. In ''&quot;Mémoire sur la combustion en général&quot;'' (&quot;On Combustion in General,&quot; 1777) and ''&quot;Considérations générales sur la nature des acides&quot;'' (&quot;General Considerations on the Nature of Acids,&quot; 1778), he demonstrated that the &quot;air&quot; responsible for combustion was also the source of acidity. In 1779, he named this part of the air &quot;oxygen&quot; (Greek for &quot;becoming sharp&quot; because he claimed that the sharp taste of acids came from oxygen), and the other &quot;[[nitrogen|azote]]&quot; (Greek for &quot;no life&quot;). In ''&quot;Réflexions sur le phlogistique&quot;'' (&quot;Reflections on Phlogiston,&quot; 1783), Lavoisier showed the [[phlogiston theory]] to be inconsistent. But Priestley refused to believe Lavoisier's results even on his death bed in Pennsylvania.

===Pioneer of stoichiometry===
Lavoisier's researches included some of the first truly [[stoichiometry|quantitative chemical experiments]]. He carefully weighed the reactants and products in a chemical reaction, which was a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry. He showed that, although matter can change its state in a chemical reaction, the total mass of matter is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical change. Thus, for instance, if water is heated to steam, if salt is dissolved in water or if a piece of wood is burned to ashes, the total mass remains unchanged. His experiments supported the law of [[conservation of mass]], which Lavoisier was the first to state,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwinger&quot; /&gt; although [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1711–1765) had previously expressed similar ideas in 1748 and proved them in experiments. Others who anticipated the work of Lavoisier include [[Jean Rey (physician)|Jean Rey]] (1583–1645), [[Joseph Black]] (1728–1799), and [[Henry Cavendish]] (1731–1810).

===Analytical chemistry and chemical nomenclature===
Lavoisier investigated the composition of water and air, which at the time were considered elements. He determined that the components of water were [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]], and that air was a mixture of gases, primarily [[nitrogen]] and oxygen. With the French chemists [[Claude-Louis Berthollet]], [[Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy|Antoine Fourcroy]] and [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau|Guyton de Morveau]], Lavoisier devised a [[IUPAC nomenclature|systematic chemical nomenclature]]. He described it in ''Méthode de nomenclature chimique'' (''Method of Chemical Nomenclature'', 1787). This system facilitated communication of discoveries between chemists of different backgrounds and is still largely in use today, including names such as ''sulfuric acid'', ''sulfates'', and ''sulfites''.

Lavoisier's ''[[Traité élémentaire de chimie]]'' (''Elementary Treatise on Chemistry'', 1789, translated into English by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]]) is considered to be the first modern chemistry [[textbook]]. It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement of the law of [[conservation of mass]], and denied the existence of [[phlogiston]]. This text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis, and presented Lavoisier's theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements.

While many leading chemists of the time refused to accept Lavoisier's new ideas, demand for ''Traité élémentaire'' as a textbook in Edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into English within about a year of its French publication.&lt;ref&gt;See the &quot;Advertisement,&quot; p. vi of Kerr's translation, and pp. xxvi-xxvii, xxviii of Douglas McKie's introduction to the Dover edition.&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, the ''Traité élémentaire'' was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation.

===Legacy===
[[File:Calorimeter.gif|thumb|100px|left|Constant [[pressure]] [[calorimeter]], engraving made by madame Lavoisier for [[thermochemistry]] experiments]]
Lavoisier's fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of the [[chemical balance]], used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids (which later turned out to be erroneous). Lavoisier also did early research in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with [[Laplace]]. They used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of [[carbon dioxide]] produced, eventually finding the same ratio for a flame and animals, indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion reaction.

Lavoisier also contributed to early ideas on composition and chemical changes by stating the radical theory, believing that [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]], which function as a single group in a chemical process, combine with oxygen in reactions. He also introduced the possibility of [[allotropy|allotropy in chemical elements]] when he discovered that [[diamond]] is a [[allotropy|crystalline form of carbon]].

However, much to his professional detriment, Lavoisier discovered no new substances, devised no really novel apparatus, and worked out no improved methods of preparation. He was essentially a theorist, and his great merit lay in the capacity of taking over experimental work that others had carried out—without always adequately recognizing their claims—and by a rigorous logical procedure, reinforced by his own quantitative experiments, of expounding the true explanation of the results. He completed the work of Black, Priestley and Cavendish, and gave a correct explanation of their experiments.

Overall, his contributions are considered the most important in advancing chemistry to the level reached in physics and mathematics during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Gillespie, Foreword to ''Lavoisier'' by Jean-Pierre Poirier, University of Pennsylvania Press, English Edition, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lavoisier humanexp.jpg|thumb|250px|Lavoisier conducting an experiment on respiration in the 1770s]]

==Contributions to biology==
Lavoisier used a [[calorimeter]] to measure heat production as a result of respiration in a [[guinea pig]]. The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow, which melted to maintain a constant temperature of {{nowrap|0°C}} around an inner shell filled with ice. The guinea pig in the center of the chamber produced heat which melted the ice. The water that flowed out of the calorimeter was collected and weighed. Lavoisier used this measurement to estimate the heat produced by the guinea pig's metabolism. Lavoisier concluded, ''&quot;la respiration est donc une combustion,&quot;'' That is, respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, like that of a candle burning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/79/5/899S Is a Calorie a Calorie?] ''American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'', Vol. 79, No. 5, 899S–906S, May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and politics==
Lavoisier received a [[law degree]] and was admitted to the [[bar association|bar]], but never practiced as a [[lawyer]]. He did become interested in French [[politics]], and at the age of 26 he obtained a position as a [[tax]] collector in the ''[[Ferme Générale]]'', a [[tax farming (France)|tax farming]] company, where he attempted to introduce reforms in the French [[monetary system|monetary]] and [[tax]]ation system to help the peasants. While in government work, he helped develop the [[SI|metric system]] to secure uniformity of [[weights and measures]] throughout France.

==Final days, execution, and aftermath==
[[File:Lavoisier-statue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Statue of Lavoisier, at [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris]]]]

One of twenty-eight French tax collectors and a powerful figure in the deeply unpopular ''Ferme Générale'', Lavoisier was branded a traitor by the [[French Revolution|revolutionaries]], during the [[Reign of Terror]], in 1794. He had also intervened on behalf of a number of foreign-born scientists including mathematician [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], granting them exception to a mandate stripping all foreigners of possessions and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=In September 1793 a law was passed ordering the arrest of all foreigners born in enemy countries and all their property to be confiscated. Lavoisier intervened on behalf of Lagrange, who certainly fell under the terms of the law, and he was granted an exception. On 8 May 1794, after a trial that lasted less than a day, a revolutionary tribunal condemned Lavoisier, who had saved Lagrange from arrest, and 27 others to death. Lagrange said on the death of Lavoisier, who was guillotined on the afternoon of the day of his trial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lavoisier was tried, convicted, and guillotined on 8 May in Paris, at the age of 50.

Lavoisier was actually one of the few liberals in his position. One of his actions that may have sealed his fate was a clash a few years earlier with the young [[Jean-Paul Marat]] whom he dismissed curtly after being presented with a preposterous &quot;scientific invention&quot; (an object which showed a spectrum of light that was as yet unseen&amp;nbsp;— but did not measure anything). Marat subsequently became a leading revolutionary and one of the French Revolution's more extreme &quot;professional common men.&quot;

An appeal to spare his life so that he could continue his experiments was cut short by the judge: ''&quot;The Republic needs neither scientists nor chemists; the course of justice can not be delayed.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;
Commenting on this quotation, Denis Duveen, an English expert on Lavoiser and a collector of his works, wrote that &quot;it is pretty certain that it was never uttered.&quot; For Duveen's evidence, see the following: {{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ed031p60 |author=Duveen, Denis I. |title=Antoine Laurent Lavoisier and the French Revolution |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=31 |month=February |issue=2 |year=1954 |pages=60&amp;nbsp;– 65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lavoisier's importance to science was expressed by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] who lamented the beheading by saying: ''&quot;Cela leur a pris seulement un instant pour lui couper la tête, mais la France pourrait ne pas en produire une autre pareille en un siècle.&quot;'' (&quot;It took them only an instant to cut off his head, but France may not produce another such head in a century.&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Delambre |first=Jean-Baptiste|contribution = Notice sur la vie et les ouvrages de M. le Comte J.-L.

One and a half years following his death, Lavoisier was exonerated by the French government. When his private belongings were delivered to his widow, a brief note was included reading &quot;To the widow of Lavoisier, who was falsely convicted.&quot;

About a century after his death, a statue of Lavoisier was erected in Paris. It was later discovered that the sculptor had not actually copied Lavoisier's head for the statue, but used a spare head of the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], the Secretary of the Academy of Sciences during Lavoisier's last years. Lack of money prevented alterations being made. The statue was melted down during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and has not since been replaced. However, one of the main &quot;[[lycée]]s&quot; (high schools) in Paris and a street in the [[VIIIe arrondissement|8th arrondissement]] are named after Lavoisier, and statues of him are found on the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] (''photograph, left'') and on the façade of the ''Cour Napoléon'' of the [[Palais du Louvre|Louvre]].
