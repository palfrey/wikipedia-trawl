'''Anatolia''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἀνατολή}} ''{{lang|gr-Latn|Anatolē}}'' — &quot;east&quot; or &quot;(sun)rise&quot;; also '''Asia Minor''', from {{Lang-el|Μικρὰ Ἀσία}} ''{{lang|gr-Latn|Mikrá Asía}}'' &quot;small Asia&quot;; in modern {{Lang-tr|Anadolu}}) is a geographic and historical term denoting the westernmost protrusion of [[Asia]], comprising the majority of the [[Republic of Turkey]]. The region is bounded by the [[Black Sea]] to the north, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the northeast, the [[Armenian Highland]] to the east, [[Mesopotamia]] to the southeast, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south and the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west. Anatolia has been home to many civilizations throughout history, such as the [[Hittites]], [[Phrygia]]ns, [[Lydia]]ns, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Armenians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Sultanate of Rûm|Anatolian Seljuks]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. As a result, Anatolia is one of the archeologically richest areas in the world.

Most of the interior of Anatolia consists of a high-altitude plateau that becomes increasingly mountainous as one moves east. The [[Sea of Marmara]] forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the [[Bosphorus]] and [[Dardanelles]] straits, and separates Anatolia from [[Thrace]] on the [[Europe]]an mainland. Anatolia is separated from the Armenian Highland to the east by the [[Euphrates]] river, and from Syria by the [[Orontes]] river.

The vast majority of the people residing in Anatolia are [[Turkish people|Turks]]. [[Kurds]], who constitute a major community in southeastern Anatolia, are the largest ethnic minority. [[Albanians]], [[Arabs]], [[Armenians]], [[Assyrians]], [[Bosnians]], [[Circassians]], [[Georgians]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]], [[Laz people|Laz]] and a number of other ethnic groups also live in Anatolia in smaller numbers.

==Name==
{{details|Names of Anatolia}}
{{Mergefrom|Names of Anatolia|date=August 2009}}
The name ''Anatolia'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Aνατολή}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|anatolē}}'') meaning the &quot;East&quot; or more literally &quot;sunrise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;etym&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%237638| title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise reference of this term has varied over time, perhaps originally referring only to the [[Ionians|Ionian]] colonies on the Asia Minor coast. In the [[Byzantine Empire]], ''[[Anatolikon]]'' was a [[thema|theme]] covering the western and central parts of Turkey's present-day [[Central Anatolia Region, Turkey|Central Anatolian Region]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;On the First Thema, Called Anatolikon. This theme is called Anatolikon, not because it is above and in the direction of the east where the sun rises, but because it lies East of Byzantium and Europe.&quot; Constantine VII Porphyogenitus, ''De Thematibus'', ed. A. Pertusi.

PAge 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical geography==
[[File:Turkey topo.jpg|thumb|300px|[[cartographic relief depiction|Relief map]] of [[Turkey]]]]

The Anatolian peninsula is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south, the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west, and the sea of Marmara to the northwest, which separates Anatolia from Thrace in Europe. To the east, Anatolia is bounded by Georgia, the Armenian Highland and the Euphrates before that river bends to the southeast to enter [[Mesopotamia]]. To the southeast, Anatolia is bounded by the ranges that separate it from the Orontes valley in [[Greater Syria]] and the Mesopotamian plain. The northern coast of Anatolia stretches farther east than the central region, reaching all the way to the modern border with Georgia.

Anatolia's terrain is structurally complex. A central [[massif]] composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded [[Trough (geology)|troughs]], covered by recent [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] and giving the appearance of a plateau with rough terrain, is wedged between two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east. True lowland is confined to a few narrow coastal strips along the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black Sea coasts. Flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the [[Kızıl River]], the coastal plains of [[Çukurova]] and the valley floors of the [[Gediz River]] and the [[Büyük Menderes River]] as well as some interior high plains in Anatolia, mainly around ''[[Lake Tuz|Tuz Gölü]]'' (Salt Lake) and the [[Konya]] Basin (''Konya Ovasi'').

==Regions==
===Black Sea Coast===
[[File:Pontic Panorama.jpg|thumb|300px|Panoramic view of the [[Pontic Mountains]]]]

The Black Sea coast is characterized by a range of steep mountains that extend along the entire length of the coast, separating it from the inland Anatolian plateau. In the west, the mountains tend to be low, with elevations from {{convert|1525|-|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but they rise in the easterly direction to heights greater than {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} south of Rize, reaching {{convert|3937|m|ft|abbr=on}} at the [[Kaçkar Mountains]] in the [[Pontic Alps]]. Lengthy, troughlike valleys and basins characterize the mountains. The southern slopes, facing the Anatolian Plateau, are mostly unwooded, but the northern slopes contain dense growths of both deciduous and evergreen trees. The higher slopes facing northwest tend to be densely forested.

The coast is rugged and rocky, with rivers that cascade through the gorges of the coastal ranges. A few larger rivers, those cutting back through the Pontic Alps, have tributaries that flow in broad, elevated basins. Access inland from the coast is limited to a few narrow valleys because mountain ridges. Because of these natural conditions, the Black Sea coast historically has been isolated from Anatolia.

===Marmara Region===
{{Main|Marmara Region, Turkey}}
[[File:View of Bursa from the hills of Mount Uludag.jpg|thumb|200px|View of [[Bursa]] from the hills near [[Uludağ]], the ancient [[Mysia]]n Olympus]]

The coast of Anatolia that borders the Sea of Marmara consists mainly of rolling plateau country well suited to agriculture. It receives about {{convert|52|cm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall annually.

Densely populated, this area includes the cities of [[Istanbul]] and Bursa, Turkey's fourth largest city. The Bosphorus, which links the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea, is about {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and averages {{convert|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} in width but narrows in places to less than {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There are two suspension bridges over the Bosphorus, both its Asian and European banks rise steeply from the water and form a succession of cliffs, coves, and nearly landlocked bays. Most of the shores are densely wooded and are marked by numerous small towns and villages. The Dardanelles Strait, which links the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean Sea, is approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and increases in width toward the south. Unlike the Bosphorus, the Dardanelles has fewer settlements along its shores.

The most important valleys are the [[İzmit|Kocaeli]] Valley, the [[Balıkesir Province|Balıkesir]] Ovası (Balıkesir Plain), the [[Bursa Province|Bursa]] Ovası (Bursa Plain), and the Plains of [[Troy]] (historically known as the [[Troad]].)

===Aegean Coast===
[[File:Oludeniz.jpg|thumb|200px|View of [[Ölüdeniz]] near [[Fethiye]]]]

Located on the west coast of Anatolia, the Aegean region has a fertile soil and a typically Mediterranean climate; with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The broad, cultivated lowland valleys contain about half of the country's richest farmlands.

The largest city in the Aegean Region of Turkey is [[İzmir]], which is also the country's third largest city and second largest port after Istanbul.

[[Olive]] and [[olive oil]] production is particularly important for the economy of the region. The seaside town of [[Ayvalık]] and numerous towns in the provinces of [[İzmir Province|İzmir]] and [[Aydın Province|Aydın]] are particularly famous for their olive oil and related products; such as soap and cosmetics.

The region is home to many famous ancient cities; places such as [[Pergamum]], [[Ephesus]], [[Miletus]], [[Halicarnassus]] (Bodrum), [[Smyrna]].

&lt;center&gt;{{wide image|BodrumPano.jpg|1000px|&lt;center&gt;Panoramic view of [[Bodrum]], ancient [[Halicarnassus]], the city of [[Herodotus]] and the home of the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]&lt;/center&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;

===Mediterranean Coast===
[[File:1362643.jpg|thumb|200px|Beaches and marina of [[Kemer]] near [[Antalya]] in the [[Turkish Riviera]]]]

Beginning in the west of [[Antalya province]], the south-facing Mediterranean coast of Turkey is separated from the interior by steep ranges, known as the Taurus mountains, that run along the entire length of the coast. The [[Taurus Mountains]] (''Toros Dağları'') are Anatolia's second chain of folded mountains. The south facing slopes rise steeply from the Mediterranean coastal plain, but slope very gently on the north side towards the Anatolian plateau. In the east, the Taurus mountains arc around the northern side of the Arabian Platform, before turning south and continuing as the ranges that define the [[Great Rift Valley]]. Between [[Adana]] and [[Antalya]], the Taurus Mountains rise sharply from the coast to high elevations, reaching altitudes of over {{convert|3700|m|ft|abbr=on}} north of Adana. The Taurus Mountains are more rugged and less dissected by rivers than the Pontus Mountains and historically have served as a barrier to human movement inland from the Mediterranean coast except where there are mountain passes such as the historic [[Cilician Gates]] (Gülek Pass), northwest of Adana.

Toward the east, the extensive plains around Adana, Turkey's fourth largest city, consist largely of reclaimed flood lands. In general, rivers have not cut valleys to the sea in the western part of the region. East of Adana, much of the coastal plain has limestone features such as collapsed caverns and sinkholes. Other than Adana, Antalya, and [[Mersin]], the Mediterranean coast has few major cities, although it has numerous farming villages.

&lt;center&gt;{{wide image|Alanya Panorama.jpg|1000px|&lt;center&gt;Panoramic view of [[Alanya]], inhabited since the Hittites and the medieval homeport of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] naval forces, famous today for its natural beauty and historic monuments&lt;/center&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;

===Central Plateau===
[[File:View of Cappadocia edit.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Cappadocia]]]]

Stretching inland from the Aegean coastal plain, the Central Anatolian plateau occupies the area between the two zones of the folded coastal ranges in the north and south, extending east to the point where the two ranges converge. The plateau-like, semiarid highlands of Anatolia are considered the heartland of the country. The region varies in elevation from {{convert|600|-|1200|m|ft|abbr=on}} from west to east. The Anatolian plateau is interspersed with extinct volcanoes, the tallest of which is Mt. [[Erciyes]], rising to {{convert|3917|m|ft|abbr=on}} near [[Kayseri]].

Frequently interspersed throughout the folded mountains, and also situated on the Anatolian Plateau, are well-defined basins, which the Turks call &quot;ova&quot;. Some are no more than a widening of a stream valley; others, such as the Konya Ovasi, are large basins of inland drainage or are the result of limestone erosion. Most of the basins take their names from cities or towns located at their rims. Where a lake has formed within the basin, the water body is usually saline as a result of the internal drainage — the water has no outlet to the sea. The two largest basins on the plateau are the [[Konya]] Ovasi and the basin occupied by the large salt lake, [[Lake Tuz|Tuz Gölü]].

Forested areas are confined to the northwest and northeast of the plateau. Rain-fed cultivation is widespread, with wheat being the principal crop. Irrigated agriculture is restricted to the areas surrounding rivers and wherever sufficient underground water is available. Important irrigated crops include barley, corn, cotton, various fruits, grapes, opium poppies, sugar beets, roses, and tobacco. There also is extensive grazing throughout the plateau.

Central Anatolia receives little annual rainfall with an average precipitation of {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} per year. The driest part of the region is the semiarid center of the plateau which receives an average yearly precipitation of only {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}. However, actual rainfall from year to year is irregular and occasionally may be less than {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}}, leading to severe reductions in crop yields for both rain-fed and irrigated agriculture. Overgrazing has contributed to soil erosion on some parts of the plateau. During the summers, frequent dust storms blow a fine yellow powder across the plateau. Locusts occasionally ravage the eastern area in April and May. In general, the plateau experiences high temperatures and almost no rainfall in summer and cold weather with heavy snow in winter.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Anatolia has a varied range of climates. The central plateau is characterized by a continental climate, with hot summers and cold snowy winters. The south and west coasts enjoy a typical Mediterranean climate, with mild rainy winters, and warm dry summers. The Black sea and Marmara coasts have temperate oceanic climate, with cool foggy summers and much rainfall throughout the year.

==Ecoregions==
Anatolia's diverse topography and climate has fostered a similar diversity of plant and animal communities.

The mountains and coastal plain of northern Anatolia, with its humid and mild climate, is home to [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf, mixed]] and [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous]] forests. The central and eastern plateau, with its drier [[continental climate]], is home to deciduous forests and forest steppes. Western and southern Anatolia, which have a [[Mediterranean climate]], are home to [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] ecoregions.

==History==
{{Main|History of Anatolia}}

===Antiquity===
[[File:Anatolia Ancient Regions base.svg|right|thumb|300px|Ancient regions of Anatolia.]]

Eastern Anatolia contains the oldest monumental structures in the world. For example, the monumental structures at [[Göbekli Tepe]] were built by hunters and gatherers a thousand years before the development of agriculture. Eastern Anatolia is also a heart region for the [[Neolithic revolution]], one of the earliest areas in which humans domesticated plants and animals. Neolithic sites such as [[Çatalhöyük]], [[Çayönü]], [[Nevali Cori]] and [[Hacilar]] represent the world's oldest known agricultural villages.

The earliest historical records of Anatolia are from the [[Akkadian Empire]] under [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] in the 24th century BC. The region was famous for exporting various raw materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman&quot;/&gt;
The [[Assyrian Empire]] claimed the resources, notably [[silver]]. One of the numerous Assyrian [[cuneiform]] records found in Anatolia at [[Kanesh]] uses an advanced system of trading computations and credit lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Charles|title= Egypt, Greece and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=0198721943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Akkadians and the Assyrians, whose Anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in Mesopotamia, the [[Hittites]] were centered at [[Hattusa]] in north-central Anatolia. They were speakers of an [[Indo-European language]] known as the &quot;[[Nesili|language of Nesa]]&quot;. Originating from [[Kültepe|Nesa]], they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BC, imposing themselves over a [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] speaking population. During the Late Bronze Age, they created an empire, the [[Hittite New Kingdom]], which reached its height in the 14th century BC. The empire included a large part of Anatolia, north-western Syria and upper Mesopotamia. After 1180 BC, the empire [[Bronze Age collapse|disintegrated]] into several independent &quot;[[Neo-Hittite]]&quot; states. Ancient Anatolia is subdivided by modern scholars into various regions named after the people that occupied them, such as [[Lydia]], [[Lycia]], [[Caria]], [[Mysia]], [[Bithynia]], [[Phrygia]], [[Galatia]], [[Lycaonia]], [[Pisidia]], [[Paphlagonia]], [[Cilicia]], and [[Cappadocia]].

Beginning with the [[Bronze Age]] Collapse at the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the west coast of Anatolia was settled by [[Ionian Greeks]]. Over several centuries, numerous [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[city states]] were established on the coasts of Anatolia. Greeks started Western philosophy on the western coast of Anatolia ([[Pre-Socratic philosophy]]). In the 6th century BC, most of Anatolia was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. In the 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the peninsula. Following his death and the breakup of his empire, Anatolia was ruled by a series of Hellenistic kingdoms. Two hundred years later western and central Anatolia came under Roman control, but it continued to be strongly influenced by [[Hellenistic culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Manjakani]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century BC, the [[Armenian people|Armenians]] established the [[Kingdom of Armenia (Antiquity)|Armenian kingdom]] under [[Tigran]] who reigned throughout much of eastern Anatolia between the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]], Black and Mediterranean seas. Anatolia is known as the birthplace of [[coin]]age as a medium of exchange (some time in the 7th century BC), which flourished during the Greek and Roman eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0415089921|last=Howgego|first=C. J.|title=Ancient History from Coins| year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaminorcoins.com Asia Minor Coins] - an index of Greek and Roman coins from Asia Minor (ancient Anatolia)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Period===
[[File:Asia Minor ca 842 AD.svg|thumb|right|300px|Byzantine Anatolia and the Byzantine-Arab frontier zone in the mid-9th century]]
[[File:Anatolia1300.png|thumb|right|300px|Beyliks and other states around Anatolia, c. 1300.]]

After the division of the Roman Empire, Anatolia became part of the East Roman, or Byzantine Empire. Byzantine control was challenged by Arab raids starting in the 7th century (see [[Byzantine–Arab Wars]]), but in the 9th and 10th century a resurgent Byzantine Empire regained its lost territories and even expanded beyond its traditional borders, into Armenia and Syria. Following the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the Seljuk Turks swept across Anatolia and conquered it in its entirety by 1080. The [[Turkish language]] and Islamic religion were gradually introduced as a result of the Seljuk conquest, and this period marks the start of Anatolia's slow transition from predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking, to predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking. In the following century, the Byzantines managed to reassert their control in Western and Northern Anatolia. Control of Anatolia was then split between the Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk [[Sultanate of Rûm]], with the Byzantine holdings gradually being reduced. In 1255, the Mongols swept through central and eastern Anatolia, and would remain until 1335. The [[Ilkhanate]] garrison was stationed near [[Ankara]].&lt;ref&gt;H. M. Balyuzi-Muḥammad and the course of Islám, p.342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Freely-Storm on Horseback: The Seljuk Warriors of Turkey, p.83&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 14th century, most of Anatolia was controlled by various [[Anatolian beyliks]]. The Turkmen Beyliks were under the control of the Mongols, at least nominally, through declining Seljuk Sultans.&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Fuat Köprülü, Gary Leiser-The origins of the Ottoman empire, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Partner-God of battles: holy wars of Christianity and Islam, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; The Beyliks did not mint coins in the names of their own leaders while they remained under the suzerainty of the Ilkhanids.&lt;ref&gt;Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Osmanli]] ruler [[Osman I]] was the first Turkish ruler who minted coins in his own name in 1320's, for it bears the legend &quot;Minted by Osman son of Ertugul&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Artuk-Osmanli Beyliginin Kurucusu, 27f&lt;/ref&gt; Since the minting of coins was a prerogative accorded in Islamic practice only to be a [[sovereign]], it can be considered that Osmanli became independent of the Mongol Khans.&lt;ref&gt;Pamuk-A Monetary history, p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

After the decline of the Ilkhanate from 1335–1353, the [[Mongol Empire]]'s legacy in the region was the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] [[Eretna Dynasty]] that was overthrown by [[Kadi Burhan al-Din]] in 1381.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Edmund Bosworth-The new Islamic dynasties: a chronological and genealogical manual, p.234&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] leaders the Ottomans emerged as great power under Osman and his son [[Orhan I]]. [[Smyrna]] was conquered in 1330, and the last Byzantine possession, Philadélphia (modern [[Alaşehir]]), fell in 1390. The Anatolian beyliks were in turn absorbed into the rising [[Ottoman Empire]] during the 15th century. The Ottomans completed the conquest of the peninsula in 1517 with the taking of Halicarnassus (Bodrum) from the [[Knights of Saint John]].

===Modern times===
[[File:Ethnicturkey1911.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ethnographic map of Anatolia from 1911.]]

With the beginning of the slow decline of the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century, and as a result of the expansionist policies of [[Czarist Russia]] in the [[Caucasus]], many Muslim nations and groups in that region, mainly [[Circassians]], [[Tatars]], [[Azeris]], [[Lezgian people|Lezgi]]s, [[Chechens]], and several [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups left their ancestral homelands and settled in Anatolia. As the Ottoman Empire further fragmented during the [[Balkan Wars]], much of the non-Christian populations of its former possessions, mainly the Balkan Muslims, flocked to Anatolia and were resettled in various locations, mostly in formerly Christian villages throughout Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;Justin McCarthy,&quot;Death and Exile: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims, 1821-1922&quot;,1996,ISBN 0-87850-094-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Anatolia remained multi-ethnic until the early 20th century (see the [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]). During [[World War I]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Greek genocide]] (especially in [[Pontus]]), and the [[Assyrian Genocide]] almost entirely removed the Armenian and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] populations of Anatolia, as well as a large part of its ethnic Greek population. Following the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922]], all remaining ethnic Anatolian Greeks were forced out during the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Since the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, Anatolia has become Turkey, its inhabitants being mainly Turks and Kurds (see [[demographics of Turkey]] and [[history of Turkey]]).
