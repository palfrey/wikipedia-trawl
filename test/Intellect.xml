'''Intellect''' is a term used in studies of the [[human]] [[mind]], and refers to the ability of the mind to come to correct conclusions about what is [[truth|true]] or [[reality|real]], and about how to [[problem solving|solve problems]]. Historically the term comes from the Greek philosophical term ''nous'', which was translated into Latin as ''[[wikt:intellectus|intellectus]]'' (derived from the verb ''intelligere'') and into French (and then English) as ''[[wikt:intelligence#French|intelligence]]''.

Discussion of the intellect can be divided into two broad areas. In both of these areas, the terms &quot;intellect&quot; and &quot;intelligence&quot; have continued to be used as related words.

*''[[Nous]]''. In philosophy, especially in [[classical philosophy|classical]] and [[medieval philosophy]] the intellect or ''[[nous]]'' is an important subject connected to the question of how humans can [[knowledge|know things]]. Especially during [[late antiquity]] and the [[middle ages]], the intellect was often proposed as a concept which could reconcile philosophical and scientific understandings of [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] with [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religious understandings, by making the intellect a link between each human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and the divine intellect (or intellects) of the [[cosmos]] itself. (During the Latin [[Middle Ages]] a distinction developed whereby the term &quot;intelligence&quot; was typically used to refer to the incorporeal beings which governed the celestial spheres in many of these accounts.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}} page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;)

*[[Intelligence]]. Discussion of [[Intelligence]] as the mental ability (or [[Theory of multiple intelligences|abilities]]) that allow people to [[understand]] things has continued as a subject studied by modern scientific [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]].

A person who uses intelligence (thought and reason) and [[critical thinking|critical]] or [[Logic|analytical]] reasoning in either a [[profession]]al or a [[Individual capacity|personal capacity]] is often referred to as an [[intellectual]].
