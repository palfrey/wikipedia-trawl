'''Abul Muzaffar Muhy-ud-Din Muhammad Aurangzeb Alamgir''' ({{lang-hi|अबुल मुज़फ्फर मुहिउद्दीन मुहम्मद औरंगज़ेब आलमगीर}}) ({{OldStyleDateDY|4 November|1618|25 October&lt;!-- Britain and the British Empire continued to use the Old Style till 1752 --&gt;}} – {{OldStyleDateDY|3 March|1707|20 February}}), more commonly known as '''Aurangzeb''' ({{lang-hi|औरंगज़ेब}}) &lt;ref&gt;({{lang-fa|اورنگ‌زیب}}, full official title: ''Al-Sultan al-Azam wal Khaqan al-Mukarram Hazrat Abul Muzaffar Muhy-ud-Din Muhammad Aurangzeb Bahadur Alamgir I, Badshah Ghazi, Shahanshah-e-Sultanat-ul-Hindiya Wal Mughaliya''&lt;/ref&gt; or by his chosen imperial title '''Alamgir''' ({{lang-hi|आलमगीर}}) (&quot;Conquerer of the World&quot;, {{lang-fa|عالمگیر}}), was the sixth [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor of India]], whose reign lasted from 1658 until his death in 1707.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Book Encyclopedia Volume 1989 pg 894-895&quot;&gt;The World Book Encyclopedia Volume:A1 (1989) pg 894-895&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=4aqU9Zu7mFoC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=aurangzeb+rebellion+series&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=fDK_SdaiF4_CzATx2MyFCA&amp;client=firefox-a Mughal Rule in India - By Stephen Meredyth Edwardes, Herbert Leonard Offley Garrett]&lt;/ref&gt;

Badshah Aurangzeb Alamgir I, having ruled most of the [[Indian subcontinent]] for nearly half a century, was the second longest reigning Mughal emperor after the legendary [[Akbar the Great|Akbar]]. In this period he tried hard to get a larger area, notably in [[southern India]], under Mughal rule than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, Bamber (1971). The Great Mughals. New York:Harper &amp; Row. pp. 233&lt;/ref&gt; But after his death in 1707, the Mughal Empire gradually began to shrink. Major reasons include a weak chain of &quot;[[Mughal Empire#Decline|Later Mughals]]&quot;, an inadequate focus on maintaining central administration leading to governors forming their own empires, a gradual depletion of the fortunes amassed by his predecessors and the growth of secessionist sentiments amongst the other communities of the empire like the [[Maratha empire|Marathas]].

==Rise to throne==
===Early life===

Aurangzeb was born as third son and sixth child to Prince Khurram (later fifth Mughal emperor [[Shah Jahan]]) and [[Mumtaz Mahal]] (Arjumand Bānū Begum) in Dohad on the way to Ujjain. After an unsuccessful rebellion by his father, Aurangzeb and his brother [[Dara Shikoh]] were submitted as hostages in June,1626 under [[Nur Jehan]] at his grandfather [[Jahangir]]'s court in Lahore.After Shah Jahan's coming to power, Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents in Agra on 26 February 1628.His daily allowance was fixed to Rs.500.Sadullah Khan (later wazir to Shah Jahan),Mir Muhammad Hashim of Gilan ,[[Muhammad Saleh Kamboh]] had been a few of his childhood teachers.He had narrowly escaped death in an elephant fight on May 28,1633, but his valor was appreciated by Shah Jahan who gave him the title &quot;Bahadur&quot; (Hero)and had him weighed in Gold and presented him gifts worth Rs 2 lakhs.This heroic deed was celebrated in Persion and Urdu verses.

{{quotation| If the fight had ended fatally for me it would not have been a matter of shame.Death drops the curtain even on Emperors; it is no dishonour.The shame lay in what my brothers did!|Aurangzeb to Shah Jahan taunting Dara Shikoh's cowardice|Ahkam-i-Alamgiri - Hamidullah Khan}}

He visited Kashmir with Shah Jahan and was presented with the parganah of Lukh-bhawan in September,1634.On 13 December,1634 he got his first post as Commander of 10000 horse, with additional 4000 troopers.He was allowed to use Red tent , a royal prerogative ,for Shah Jahan had big plans for him. 

===Bundela War ,1635===

To contain the Bundela rebellion under Jhujhar Singh , Shah Jahan organized an expedition to converge upon Bundelkhand from 3 sides : Syed Khan-i-Jahan with 10,500 men from Badaun , Abdullah Khan Bahadur Firuz Jang with 6000 men from north and Khan-i-Dauran with 6000 men from south-west.The three generals were of equal rank and hence to ensure unity and co-operation among them , Aurangzeb , the 16 year old commander of 10,000 and escorted by 1000 archers and 1000 horses ,was made the (nominal) chief of mission.He was to stay in the rear,away from fighting and take advice from the generals , but his call was decisive and no general could act without consulting him.

{{quotation| If the campaign was meant to be Aurangzeb's baptimism of fire , we must say the baptimism was performed at a great distance from the fire|Dow's account of the war.}}

The armies captured the Bundela capital on October 4,1635 and installed Devi Singh as Rajah , while Jhujhar Singh had escaped.After a flurry of events , the Gonds killed Jhujhar and his son in their sleep and sent their head to Shah Jahan in December 1635.Aurangzeb had come to Dhamuni where Shah Jahan paid him a visit.He ordered demolition of Bir Singh Dev's temple and had a mosque constructed.

Aurangzeb returned from Dhamuni to wait for his father at Uruchha and together they travelled through the country.On the way to Sironj they reached Daulatabad where Aurangzeb on July 14,1636 took formal leave of the emperor to act as the Viceroy of the [[Deccan]].&lt;ref&gt;Khafi Khan, Muntakhab ul-Lubab, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, he began building a new city near the former capital of Khirki which he named [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] after himself. In 1637, he married Rabia Durrani. During this period the [[Deccan]] was relatively peaceful. In the Mughal court, however, Shah Jahan began to show greater and greater favoritism to his eldest son [[Dara Shikoh]].

In 1644, Aurangzeb's sister [[Jahanara Begum]] was accidentally burned in [[Agra]]. This event precipitated a family crisis which had political consequences. Aurangzeb suffered his father's displeasure when he returned to Agra three weeks after the event, instead of immediately. Shah Jahan dismissed him as the governor of the Deccan. Aurangzeb later claimed (1654) that he had resigned in protest of his father favoring Dara.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In 1645, he was barred from the court for seven months. But later, Shah Jahan appointed him governor of [[Gujarat]]; he performed well and was rewarded. In 1647, Shah Jahan made him governor of [[Balkh]] and [[Badakhshan]] (in modern [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]), replacing Aurangzeb's ineffective brother [[Murad Baksh]]. These areas at the time were under attack from various forces and Aurangzeb's military skill proved successful.

He was appointed governor of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]], and began a protracted military struggle against the [[Safavid]] army in an effort to capture the city of [[Kandahar]]. He failed, and fell again into his father's disfavour.

In 1652, Aurangzeb was re-appointed governor of the [[Deccan]]. In an effort to extend the empire, Aurangzeb attacked the border kingdoms of [[Golconda]] (1657), and [[Adil Shahi|Bijapur]] (1658). Both times, Shah Jahan called off the attacks near the moment of Aurangzeb's triumph. In each case Dara Shikoh interceded and arranged a peaceful end to the attacks.

===War of succession===
[[File:ShujaAurganzebMurad.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A painting from circa 1637 shows the brothers (left to right) Shuja, Aurangzeb and Murad Baksh in their younger years.]]

[[Shah Jahan]] fell ill in 1657. With this news, the struggle for the succession began. Aurangzeb's eldest brother, [[Dara Shikoh]], was regarded as heir apparent, but the succession proved far from certain when Shah Jahan's second son [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]] declared himself emperor in [[Bengal]]. Imperial armies sent by Dara and Shah Jahan soon restrained this effort, and Shuja retreated.

Soon after, Shuja's youngest brother [[Murad Baksh]], with secret promises of support from Aurangzeb, declared himself emperor in [[Gujarat]]. Aurangzeb, ostensibly in support of Murad, marched north from Aurangabad, gathering support from nobles and generals. Following a series of victories, Aurangzeb declared that Dara had illegally usurped the throne. Shah Jahan, determined that Dara would succeed him, handed over control of his empire to Dara.  A [[Rajput]] lord opposed to Aurangzeb and Murad, [[Maharaja Jaswant Singh]], battled them both at Dharmatpur near [[Ujjain]]. Aurangzeb eventually defeated Singh and concentrated his forces on Dara. A series of bloody battles followed, with troops loyal to Aurangzeb battering Dara's armies at [http://horsesandswords.blogspot.com/2006/01/battle-of-samugarh.html Samugarh]. In a few months, Aurangzeb's forces surrounded Agra. Fearing for his life, Dara departed for [[Delhi]], leaving Shah Jahan behind. The old emperor surrendered the [[Agra Fort]] to Aurangzeb's nobles, but Aurangzeb refused any meeting with his father, and declared that Dara was no longer a Muslim.

In a sudden reversal, Aurangzeb arrested his brother Murad, whose former supporters defected to Aurangzeb in return for rich gifts.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of India (1922), vol. IV, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Dara gathered his forces, and moved to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The army sent against Shuja was trapped in the east, its generals [[Jai Singh I|Jai Singh]] and Diler Khan, submitted to Aurangzeb, but allowed Dara's son Suleman to escape.  Aurangzeb offered Shuja the governorship of [[Bengal]]. This move had the effect of isolating Dara and causing more troops to defect to Aurangzeb.  Shuja, however, uncertain of Aurangzeb's sincerity, continued to battle his brother, but his forces suffered a series of defeats at Aurangzeb's hands. Shuja fled to Arakan (in present-day Burma), where he was executed after leading a failed coup.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of India (1922), vol. IV, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;  Murad was finally executed, ostensibly for the murder of his former ''divan'' Ali Naqi, in 1661.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of India (1922), vol. IV, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Shuja and Murad disposed of, and with his father Shah Jahan confined in Agra, Aurangzeb pursued Dara, chasing him across the north-western bounds of the empire. After a series of battles, defeats and retreats, Dara was betrayed by one of his generals, who arrested and bound him. In 1659, Aurangzeb arranged his formal coronation in [[Delhi]]. He had Dara openly marched in chains back to Delhi; when Dara finally arrived, Aurangzeb had him executed on 30 August 1659. Having secured his position, Aurangzeb kept an already weakening Shah Jahan under house arrest at the Agra Fort. Shah Jahan died in 1666.

==Aurangzeb's reign==
===Establishment of Islamic law===
[[File:A late Mughal Qur'an leaf.jpg|thumb|250x| A quran produced in the times of the Mughal empire.]]
[[File:Voyage de Francois Bernier by Paul Maret 1710.jpg|thumb|[[François Bernier]] (1625–1688), a [[French people|French]] [[physician]] and traveler, became for 12 years the personal physician of Aurangzeb. He described his experiences in ''Travels in the Mughal Empire''.]]

Soon after his ascension, Aurangzeb purportedly abandoned the liberal religious viewpoints of his predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;John Keay,''India: A History''(2001) p.336&lt;/ref&gt;  Though [[Akbar]], [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]]'s approach to faith was more [[wikt:syncretic|syncretic]] than [[Babur|the empire's founder]], Aurangzeb's position is not so obvious. While his conservative interpretation of Islam and belief in the [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) is well documented, how this affected the empire remains unclear. Despite claims of sweeping edicts and policies, contradictory accounts exist.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Butler Brown, ''Did Aurangzeb Ban Music?'' (2007), p.91&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, his compilation of the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], a digest of Muslim law, was either intended for personal use, never enforced, or only poorly done. While some assert the lack of broad adoption was due to an inherent flaw,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mwlusa.org/topics/marriage&amp;divorce/muslim_family_law_pakistan.html Hanafi law was sought to be codified under Aurangzeb but the work of several hundred jurists, called Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, seems too inclined to favour the Mughal elite to be useful for today's egalitarian society]&lt;/ref&gt; others insist they were only intended for his observance.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Butler Brown, ''Did Aurangzeb Ban Music?''(2007), p.114&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible the war of succession and a continued incursions combined with Shah Jahan's spending made cultural expenditures impossible,&lt;ref&gt;Taymiya R. Zaman ''Inscribing Empire: Sovereignty and Subjectivity in Mughal Memoirs''(2007) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Aurangzeb's orthodoxy is also used to explain his infamous &quot;burial&quot; of music. The scene describing the &quot;death of music&quot;(and all other forms of performance) is paradoxically dramatic.

[[Niccolao Manucci]]'s [[Storia do Mogor]] and [[Khafi Khan]]'s [[Muntakhab al-Lubab]] are the only documents which describe the aforementioned event. In Storia do Mogor, Manucci describes the ramifications of Aurangzeb's 1668 decree.&lt;ref&gt;It should be noted; this date is never specified by Manucci. However, events surrounding the statement, the chronology of which is not under dispute, are used to extrapolate a general timeframe.&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, Aurangzeb's instructions for the [[muhtasib]] seem particularly damning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''In Hindustan both Moguls and Hindus are very fond of listening to songs and instrumental music. He therefore ordered the same official to stop music. If in any house or elsewhere he heard the sound of singing and instruments, he should forthwith hasten there and arrest as many as he could, breaking the instruments. Thus was caused a great destruction of musical instruments. Finding themselves in this difficulty, their large earnings likely to cease, without there being any other mode of seeking a livelihood, the musicians took counsel together and tried to appease the king in the following way: About one thousand of them assembled on a Friday when Aurangzeb was going to the mosque. They came out with over twenty highly-ornamented biers, as is the custom of the country, crying aloud with great grief and many signs of feeling, as if they were escorting to the grave some distinguished defunct.	From afar Aurangzeb saw this multitude and heard their great weeping and lamentation, and, wondering, sent to know the cause of so much sorrow. The musicians redoubled their outcry and their tears, fancying the king would take compassion upon them. Lamenting,they replied with sobs that the king's orders had killed Music, therefore they were bearing her to the grave. Report was made to the king, who quite calmly remarked that they should pray for the soul of Music, and see that she was thoroughly well buried. In spite of this, the nobles did not cease to listen to songs in secret. This strictness was enforced in the principal cities''.&lt;ref&gt;Niccolao Manucci, ''Storia do Mogor'' (1907), vol. 11 p.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/download/storiadomogororm02manuuoft/storiadomogororm02manuuoft.pdf Pdf of Storia do Mogor vol. ii]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This implies he not only placed a prohibition on music, but actively sought and crushed any resistance. Without music, and implicitly dance, many Hindu-inspired practices&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archnet.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdownloader%2Fpdf%2F4966%2Fdoc%2FDPC0807.pdf Pdf which Details: Balcony Appearances and Other Such Hindu Inspired Mughal Activities]&lt;/ref&gt; would have been impossible. Lavish celebrations of the Emperor's birthday, commonplace since the time of Akbar, would certainly be forbidden under such conditions. Oddly, artistic work not only steadied during Aurangzeb's reign, it increased.&lt;ref&gt;Allison Busch, ''Brajbhasha Poets at the Mughal Court''(2009), p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst these and other contradictions, the validity and bias of Manucci and Khafi Khan's work is being questioned.

Another particularly heinous claim against Aurangzeb, was his policy of temple destruction. Though figures vary wildly from 80 to 60,000,&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Eaton ''Temple Desecration and Indo-Muslim States''(2000) p.297&lt;/ref&gt; it clearly took place to some extent. However, Aurangzeb's Firmans on behalf of the Balaji or Vishnu Temple,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Fn7GhTpJ4esC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;ots=n_1c4gWmr8&amp;dq=Balaji%20temple%20aurangzeb&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=firmans&amp;f=false Aurangzeb and the Balaji]&lt;/ref&gt; Varanasi insist these events weren't universal. Noted Historian [[Richard Eaton (historian)|Richard Eaton]] believes the overall understanding of temples to be flawed.  As early as the sixth century, temples became vital political landmarks as well as religious ones.  In fact, not only was temple desecration widely practiced and accepted, it was a necessary part of political struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Eaton ''Temple Desecration and Indo-Muslim States''(2000) p.295&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francois Bernier]], traveled and chronicled Mughal India during the war of succession, notes both [[Shah Jahan]] and Aurangzeb's distaste for Christians. This led to the demolition of [[Christian]] settlements near the British/European Factories and enslavement of Christian converts by Shah Jahan. Furthermore, Aurangzeb stopped all aid to Christian Missionaries (Frankish Padres) initiated by [[Akbar]] and [[Jahangir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francois Bernier]]; Travels Through the Mogul Empire ISBN 978-1931641227&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|November 2009|date=September 2010}}

===Aurangzeb's views on the Jizya (poll tax)===
From Aurangzeb's Fatwa:&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Fatawa al-Alamgiriyyah : Al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah fi Madhhab al-Imam al-A'zam Abi Hanifah al-Nu'man'' (Beirut: Dar al-Ma'rifah, 1973), 2:244-245.- Translated by Anver Emon of the Department of History, UCLA.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;''[Jizyah] refers to what is taken from the Dhimmis, according to [what is stated in] al-Nihayah. It is obligatory upon [1] the free, [2] adult members of [those] who are generally fought, [3] who are fully in possession of their mental faculties, and [4] gainfully employed, even if [their] profession is not noble, as is [stated in] al-Sarajiyyah. There are two types of (jizyah). [The first is] the jizyah that is imposed by treaty or consent, such that it is established in accordance with mutual agreement, according to (what is stated in) al-Kafi. (The amount) does not go above or below (the stipulated) amount, as is stated in al-Nahr al-Fa'iq. (The second type) is the jizyah that the leader imposes when he conquers the unbelievers (kuffar), and (whose amount) he imposes upon the populace in accordance with the amount of property [they own], as in al-Kafi. This is an amount that is pre-established, regardless of whether they agree or disagree, consent to it or not''.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;''The wealthy (are obligated to pay) each year forty-eight dirhams (of a specified weight), payable per month at the rate of 4 dirhams. The next, middle group (wast al-hal) [must pay] twenty-four dirhams, payable per month at the rate of 2 dirhams. The employed poor are obligated to pay twelve dirhams, in each month paying only one dirham, as stipulated in Fath al-Qadir, al-Hidayah, and al-Kafi. (The scholars) address the meaning of &quot;gainfully employed&quot;, and the correct meaning is that it refers to one who has the capacity to work, even if his profession is not noble. The scholars also address the meaning of wealthy, poor, and the middle group. Al-Shaykh al-Imam Abu Ja'far, may Allah the most high have mercy on him, considered the custom of each region decisive as to whom the people considered in their land to be poor, of the middle group, or rich. This is as such, and it is the most correct view, as stated in al-Muhit. Al-Karakhi says that the poor person is one who owns two hundred dirhams or less, while the middle group owns more than two hundred and up to ten thousand dirhams, and the wealthy (are those) who own more than ten thousand dirhams...The support for this, according to al-Karakhi is provided by the fatawa of Qadi Khan (died 592/1196). It is necessary that in the case of the employed person, he must have good health for most of the year, as is stated in al-Hidayah. It is mentioned in al-Idah that if a dhimmi is ill for the entire year such that he cannot work and he is well off, he is not obligated to pay the jizyah, and likewise if he is sick for half of the year or more. If he quits his work while having the capacity (to work) he (is still liable) as one gainfully employed, as is [stated in] al-Nihayah. No jizyah is imposed upon their women, children, ill persons or the blind, or likewise on the paraplegic, the very old, or on the unemployed poor, as is stated in al-Hidayah.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Expansion of the Mughal Empire===
[[File:Darbarscene.jpg|thumb|250px|Emperor Aurangzeb seated on a golden throne holding a [[hawk]] in the [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]. Such scenes would be rare in the latter part of his reign as he was permanently camped in the Deccan, fighting wars.]]

From the start of his reign up until his death, Aurangzeb engaged in almost constant warfare. He built up a massive army, and began a program of military expansion along all the boundaries of his empire. Aurangzeb pushed north-west into the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and what is now [[Afghanistan]]; he also drove south, conquering three [[Muslim]] kingdoms: [[Nizams]]'s of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Adilshahi]]'s of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]] and [[Qutbshahi]]'s of [[Golconda]]. 

[[Nizams]]'s of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Adilshahi]]'s of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]] mostly surrendered and their territories were administered by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Nawab]]. [[Qutbshahi]]'s of [[Golconda]] however refused to surrender they fortified themselves at Golconda Fort, and fiercely protected [[Kollur Mine]] (the worlds only [[diamond mine]]). After a long siege [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] forces managed to penetrate the walls by capturing a gate. [[Qutbshahi]]'s of [[Golconda]] and [[Abul Hasan Qutb Shah]] surrendered and handed over the [[Nur-Ul-Ain Diamond]], [[The Hope Diamond]], [[Wittelsbach Diamond]] and the [[The Regent Diamond]] making the [[Mughal Emperor]] the richest monarch in the world.

This combination of military expansion and religious intolerance had deeper consequences. Though he succeeded in expanding Mughal control, it was at an enormous cost in lives and treasure. And, as the empire expanded in size, Aurangzeb's chain of command grew weaker.  The [[Sikh]]s of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] grew both in strength and numbers, and launched rebellions. The Marathas waged a war with Aurangzeb which lasted for [[War of 27 years|27 years]].  Even Aurangzeb's own armies grew restive — particularly the fierce [[Rajput]]s, who were his main source of strength. Aurangzeb gave a wide berth to the Rajputs, who were mostly Hindu. While they fought for Aurangzeb during his life, on his death they immediately revolted against his successors.

With much of his attention on military matters, Aurangzeb's political power waned, and his incompetent provincial [[Nawab]]s grew in authority.

===Foreign Relations===
Aurangzeb sent rich gifts to holy men of Mecca and Medina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Shah Jahan had exchanged ambassadors with Ottoman Sultan [[Murad IV]], though no ambassadors were exchanged in Aurangzeb's reign.He,however sympathized with Ottomans over their European defeats.[[Suleiman II]] had asked for his help after defeat at Vienna , but Aurangzeb was too busy with Deccan wars to commit.


 
===Revenue administration===
Emperor Aurangzeb's exchequer raised a record £100 million in annual revenue through various sources like taxes, customs and land revenue, ''et al.'' from 24 provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=yUhvfR1S_UEC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=aurangzeb+revenue+million&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CfZLTKD4J8qUrAf1s525Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; A pound sterling was exchanged at 10 rupees then.

==Rebellions==
Aurangzeb's reign is marked by numerous rebellions in the distant provinces of the [[Mughal Empire]], many historians believe that [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Nawab]]s were incapable of bridging the gap between the rulers and the people; therefore many new identities emerged along with it armed rebellion.

*In 1669, the Jat peasants of Bharatpur around [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] revolted and led to the formation of [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]] state, they formulated a fierce rebellion around the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] capitol.

*In 1670, [[Shivaji]], assassinated the [[Adil Shahi]] commander [[Afzal Khan]] and later his rebels almost killed the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Viceroy]] [[Shaista Khan]], and waged the war against the [[Mughal Emperor]] Aurangzeb. Shivaji and his forces ravaged the [[Deccan]], [[Janjira]] and tried to gain control of vast territories. However by 1689 Auranzeb's armies had captured the successor of [[Shivaji]], his son [[Sambhaji]] alive and executed. But even after Sambhaji's death, Aurangzeb could never completely eradicate the [[Maratha]] rebels ever in his 27 years of war against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FzmkFXSgxqgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA52&amp;lpg=RA1-PA52&amp;dq=aurangzeb+in+deccan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ndtGz0s1mw&amp;sig=GUaMJ0So6bhGdFk4z1J6-9eIT24&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dx5zSr70OKShjAfk6-2nBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  An atlas and survey of South Asian history By Karl J. Schmidt]&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1672, the [[Satnami]], a sect concentrated in an area near Delhi, under the leadership of Bhirbhan and some Satnami, took over the administration of [[Narnaul]], but they were eventually crushed upon Aurangzeb's personal intervention with very few escaping alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4aqU9Zu7mFoC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=satnami+aurangzeb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2UuovD_HlV&amp;sig=eqoNlOz8jV1dP7swTknYpXWCfRU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4SBzStO0DaHbjQes7einBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=satnami%20aurangzeb&amp;f=false Mughal rule in India By Stephen Meredyth Edwardes, Herbert Leonard Offley Garrett ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ISFBJarYX7YC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;dq=satnami+aurangzeb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1wULoJ-qsv&amp;sig=nmJn36Pf-XJ99oDWw_iRonT5ajU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4SBzStO0DaHbjQes7einBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#v=onepage&amp;q=satnami%20aurangzeb&amp;f=false Students' Britannica India By Dale Hoiberg, Indu Ramchandani]&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1699, on his orders the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] governor of Sarhind surrounded the fort of Anandpur in Punjab, which was occupied by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] and well armed [[Sikh]]s. After oaths of safety by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] forces, Guru Gobind Singh decided to leave the fort. However the Mughal forces broke their promises and attacked the Guru and the Sikhs. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s held his 2 young sons [[Sahibzada Zorawar Singh]] and [[Sahibzada Fateh Singh]] captive and executed through [[Immurement]].  Meanwhile his elder sons (15 and 17 years old) named [[Sahibzada Jujhar Singh]] and [[Sahibzada Ajit Singh]] fell fighting [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Musketeers]] at Chamkaur (close to Anandpur Fort).  Gobind Singh wrote a letter named [[Zafarnamah]] to Aurungzeb. The letter is written in exquisite [[Persian language|Persian]] verse. In this letter, Guru Gobind Singh Ji reminds Aurangzeb how he and his henchmen had broken their oaths taken by the holy [[Qu'ran]] and loyalty to the [[Mughal Empire]].

*In 1671, The [[Battle of Saraighat]] between the [[Mughal Empire]] , and the [[Ahom Kingdom]]. The battle was a disaster for the Mughal army. The Mughal army was utterly annihilated due to the bravery of the Ahom general and his Assamese army. This battle was a watershed point in Indian history since it seriously checked Mughal invasions notably under the cruelest among them all, Aurangzeb. During the battle the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]'s were led by [[Mir Jumla II]] and [[Shaista Khan]]. During the course of the battle the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Admiral]], [[Munnawar Khan]] was killed.

===The Deccan wars and the Rise of the Marathas===
[[File:Asif tomb.jpg|250px|thumb|Aurangzeb spent more than 20years of his life fighting major and minor rebellions throughout the [[Mughal Empire]].]]
In the time of Shah Jahan, the Deccan had been controlled by three Muslim kingdoms: [[Ahmednagar]] ([[Nizams]]), [[Bijapur]] ([[Adilshahi]]) and [[Golconda]] ([[Qutbshahi]]). Following a series of battles, Ahmednagar was effectively divided, with large portions of the kingdom ceded to the Mughals and the balance to Bijapur. One of Ahmednagar's generals, a Hindu [[Maratha]] named [[Shahaji]], joined the Bijapur court. Shahaji sent his wife Jijabai and young son [[Shivaji]] in [[Pune]] to look after his Jagir.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid, Dennis (1937). The Grand Rebel. London:Collins Press. pp. 50,51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1657, while Aurangzeb attacked Golconda and Bijapur, Shivaji, using guerrilla tactics, took control of three Adilshahi forts formerly controlled by his father. With these victories, Shivaji assumed de facto leadership of many independent Maratha clans. The Marathas harried the flanks of the warring Adilshahi and Mughals, gaining weapons, forts, and territories.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid 1937:72-78&lt;/ref&gt;  Shivaji's small and ill-equipped army survived an all out Adilshahi attack, and Shivaji personally killed the [[Adilshahi]] general, [[Afzal Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid 1937:121-125&lt;/ref&gt;  With this event, the Marathas transformed into a powerful military force, capturing more and more Adilshahi and Mughal territories.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid 1937:130-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before Shivaji Raje's his coronation in 1659, Aurangzeb sent his trusted general and maternal uncle [[Shaista Khan]] the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Viceroy]] to the Deccan to recover lost forts occupied by the Maratha rebels. Shaista Khan drove into [[Maratha]] territory and took up residence in [[Pune]]. In a daring raid, Shivaji attacked the governor's residence in Pune during a midnight wedding celebration. The [[Maratha]]s killed Shaista Khan's son, even hacking off most of Shaista Khan's hand. [[Shaista Khan]] however barely survived and was re-appointed as the administrator of [[Bengal]] and was a key commander in the war against the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahoms]].

Aurangzeb ignored the rise of the Marathas for the next few years as he was occupied with other religious and political matters including the rise of Sikhism. Shivaji captured forts belonging to both Mughals and Bijapur. At last Aurangzeb sent his powerful general [[Jai Singh I|Raja Jai Singh]] of [[Amber, India|Amber]], a Hindu Rajput, to attack the Marathas. Jai Singh won fort of Purandar after fierce battle in which the maratha commander Murarbaji fell. Foreseeing defeat, Shivaji agreed for a truce and meeting Aurangjeb at Delhi. Jai Singh also promised the Maratha hero his safety, placing him under the care of his own son, the future Raja [[Ram Singh I]].  However, circumstances at the Mughal court were beyond the control of the Raja, and when Shivaji and his son [[Sambhaji]] went to Agra to meet Aurangzeb, they were placed under house arrest, from which they managed to effect a daring escape.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid 1937:197&lt;/ref&gt;

Shivaji returned to the Deccan, and was crowned [[Chhatrapati]] or Emperor of the Maratha Empire in 1674.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid 1937:283&lt;/ref&gt; While Aurangzeb continued to send troops against him, Shivaji expanded Maratha control throughout the Deccan until his death in 1680. Shivaji was succeeded by his son Sambhaji. Militarily and politically, Mughal efforts to control the Deccan continued to fail. Aurangzeb's son [[Sultan Muhammad Akbar|Akbar]] left the Mughal court and joined [[Muslim]] rebels in [[Deccan]]. Aurangzeb in response moved his court to Aurangabad and took over command of the Deccan campaign. More battles ensued, and Akbar fled to [[Persia]] and never returned.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoine 1971:228-229&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1689 Aurangzeb's forces captured [[Sambhaji]], his successor [[chhatrapati]] Rajaram and his, Maratha forces fought individual battles against the forces of the [[Mughal Empire]], and territory changed hands again and again during years of endless warfare. As there was no central authority among the Marathas, Aurangzeb was forced to contest every inch of territory, at great cost in lives and treasure against an organized force. Even as Aurangzeb drove west, deep into Maratha territory — notably conquering [[Satara]] — the Marathas expanded their attacks further into Mughal lands, including Mughal provinces of [[Malwa]], [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], [[Jinji]] in [[TamilNadu]]. Aurangzeb waged continuous war in the Deccan for more than two decades with no resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoine 1971:239-246&lt;/ref&gt; Aurangzeb lost about a fifth of his army fighting rebellions led by the [[Maratha]]s in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan India]]. He came down thousands of miles to the Deccan to conquer the Maratha confederacy and eventually died at the age of 90, during his final campaign against the Maratha confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=wLrwmEvTDNYC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=aurangzeb+rebellion+series&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=yzK_SanGGJGszQTjyo3GCw&amp;client=firefox-a The Story of the World - By S. Wise Bauer, Sarah Park, James]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chatrapati===
When Maharaja Jaswant Singh of [[Jodhpur]] died in 1679, a conflict ensued over who would be the next Raja. Aurangzeb's choice of a nephew of the former Maharaja was not accepted by other members of Jaswant Singh's family and they rebelled, but in vain. Aurangzeb seized control of Jodhpur. He also moved on [[Udaipur]], which was the only other state of [[Rajputana]] to support the rebellion. There was never a clear resolution to this conflict, although it is noted that the other Rajputs, including the celebrated [[Kachhwaha]] Rajput clan of Raja Jai Singh, the [[Bhatti]]s, and the [[Rathore]]s, remained loyal. On the other hand, Aurangzeb's own third son, Prince Akbar, along with a few Muslim Mansabdar supporters, joined the rebels in the hope of dethroning his father and becoming emperor. &lt;!-- ? (Once again the easy divide of Muslim Aurangzeb versus 'all the Hindus' is called into question.) --&gt; The rebels were defeated and Akbar fled south to the shelter of the Maratha Chhatrapati [[Sambhaji]], Chhatrapati Shivaji's successor.

The Ahoms (the people of Shan community of Thailand) were the kings who had established their kingdom in the basin of river Bramhaputra and made it impossible for the Mughals to conquer that area.

===The Pashtun rebellion===
The [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribesmen of the Empire were considered the bedrock of the [[Mughal Army]].  They were crucial defenders of the Empire from the threat of invasion from the North-West as well as the main fighting force against the Sikh and Maratha forces. The Pashtun revolt in 1672 under the leadership of the warrior poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afghan-web.com/bios/yest/kkk.html &quot;Biography: Khushal Khan Khattak&quot; Afghan-Web]&lt;/ref&gt; was triggered when soldiers under the orders of the Mughal Governor Amir Khan allegedly attempted to molest women of the [[Safi tribe]] in modern day [[Kunar Province|Kunar]]. The Safi tribes  attacked the soldiers. This attack provoked a reprisal, which triggered a general revolt of most of  tribes. Attempting to reassert his authority, Amir Khan led a large Mughal Army to the [[Khyber Pass]]. There the army was surrounded by tribesmen and routed, with only four men, including the Governor, managing to escape.

After that the revolt spread, with the Mughals suffering a near total collapse of their authority along the Pashtun belt. The closure of the important [[Attock]]-[[Kabul]] trade route along the [[Grand Trunk road]] was particularly critical. By 1674, the situation had deteriorated to a point where Aurangzeb himself camped at Attock to personally take charge. Switching to diplomacy and bribery along with force of arms, the Mughals eventually split the rebellion and while they never managed to wield effective authority outside the main trade route, the revolt was partially suppressed. However the long term anarchy on the Empire's North-Western frontier that prevailed as a consequence ensured that the Persian [[Nadir Shah]]'s forces half a century later faced little resistance on the road to [[Delhi]], being one of the causes for Mughal decline and eventual European dominance.

Aurangzeb's vast imperial campaigns against rebellion-affected areas of the [[Mughal Empire]], caused his opponents to exaggerate the &quot;importance&quot; of their rebellions. The results of his vast campaigns were made worse by the incompetence of his regional [[Nawabs]]. His critics decry this as intolerance,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/feb/16francois.htm The truth about Aurangzeb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim views regarding Aurangzeb vary, most Muslim historians believe that the [[Mughal Emperor]] Aurangzeb was the last powerful ruler of an empire inevitably on the verge of decline. The major rebellions organized by the [[Sikh]]s and the [[Maratha]]s were long embedded and had deep roots in the remote regions of the [[Mughal Empire]].

Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb considered the royal treasury as a trust of the citizens of his empire. He made caps and copied Quran to earn money for his use. He did not use royal treasury for personal expenses or extravagant building projects except, perhaps, for one project: he built the famous [[Badshahi Mosque]] in [[Lahore]], which, for 313 years remained the world's largest mosque and still remains to this day the 5th largest mosque in the world.  He also added a small marble mosque known as the ''[[Moti Masjid (Delhi)|Moti Masjid]]'' (Pearl Mosque) to the [[Delhi Fort|Red Fort]] complex in Delhi. His constant warfare especially with [[Marathas]], however, drove his empire to the brink of bankruptcy just as much as the wasteful personal spending and opulence of his predecessors.

[[File:Aurangzeb reading the Quran.jpg|thumb|left|Aurangzeb reading the [[Quran]].]]

[[Stanley Wolpert]] writes in his ''New History of India'' that:

''{{quote|the conquest of the Deccan, to which, Aurangzeb devoted the last 26 years of his life, was in many ways a Pyrrhic victory, costing an estimated hundred thousand lives a year during its last decade of futile chess game warfare...The expense in gold and rupees can hardly be accurately estimated. [Aurangzeb]'s moving capital alone- a city of tents 30 miles in circumference, some 250 bazaars, with a {{frac|1|2}} million camp followers, 50,000 camels and 30,000 elephants, all of whom had to be fed, stripped peninsular India of any and all of its surplus grain and wealth... Not only famine but bubonic plague arose...Even Aurangzeb, had ceased to understand the purpose of it all by the time he was nearing 90... &quot;I came alone and I go as a stranger. I do not know who I am, nor what I have been doing,&quot; the dying old man confessed to his son in February 1707.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wolpert|first=Stanley|year=2003|title=New History of India|edition=7th|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195166779}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Aurangzebs tomb.jpg|thumb|140px|Aurangzeb's tomb in [[Khuldabad]], in 1890s ]]
He died in [[Ahmednagar]] on Friday, 20 February 1707 at the age of 88, having outlived many of his children. His modest open-air grave in [[Khuldabad]] expresses his deep devotion to his Islamic beliefs. The tomb lies within the courtyard of the shrine of the Sufi saint Shaikh Burham-u'd-din Gharib (died 1331), who was a disciple of [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] of Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e239?_hi=1&amp;_pos=1&lt;/ref&gt;

After Aurangzeb's death, his son [[Bahadur Shah I]] took the throne. The Mughal Empire, due both to Aurangzeb's over-extension and  to Bahadur Shah's weak military and leadership qualities, entered a period of long decline.  Immediately after Bahadur Shah occupied the throne, the Maratha Empire — which Aurangzeb had held at bay, inflicting high human and monetary costs — consolidated and launched effective invasions of Mughal territory, seizing power from the weak emperor.  Within 100 years of Aurangzeb's death, the Mughal Emperor had little power beyond Delhi.
