Wikipedia Trawler
=================
This started off as a tool just to play `Get to Philosophy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Get_to_Philosophy>`_ in response to http://xkcd.com/903/, but it's become something more in that it now doesn't just stop at Philosophy but keeps going until it hits a loop (which is usually "Philosophy")

TODO
----
Import a full copy of a wikipedia dump and find out what percentage of all articles get to philosophy, what's the largest loop and generally fix the "Chains" list on the main page
